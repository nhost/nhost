[Nhost](http://nhost.io) is an open-source Firebase alternative with GraphQL.

The Nhost CLI is used to set up a local development environment. This environment will automatically track database migrations and Hasura metadata.

It's recommended to use the Nhost CLI and the [Nhost GitHub Integration](https://docs.nhost.io/platform/github-integration) to develop locally and automatically deploy changes to production with a git-based workflow (similar to Netlify & Vercel).

## Documentation

- [Get started with Nhost CLI (longer version)](https://docs.nhost.io/platform/overview/get-started-with-nhost-cli)

## Build from Source

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.18 or later installed.

The source code includes a self-signed certificate for testing purposes. Nhost workers with configured access to AWS may use the `cert.sh` script to generate a real certificate from Let's Encrypt.

```bash
go build -o /usr/local/bin/nhost
```
This will build the binary available as the `nhost` command in the terminal.

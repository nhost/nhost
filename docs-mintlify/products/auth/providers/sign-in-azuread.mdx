## Set up Azure AD

1. Visit the Azure Portal and create an account if needed.
2. Navigate to "Microsoft Entra ID".
3. Under "Manage", select "App Registrations".
4. Click "+ New Registration" and fill out the form:
   * Name: Choose a descriptive name
   * Supported Account Type: Select based on your needs
   * Redirect URI: Choose "Web" and enter your Auth service's callback URL (e.g., https://&lt;subdomain&gt;.auth.&lt;region&gt;.nhost.run/v1/signin/provider/azuread/callback)
   * Click "Register"

<Note>
Find the Redirect URL in your project settings -> Sign In Methods after enabling Azure AD.
</Note>

5. Copy the "Application (client) ID" for later use.
6. Create a new client secret:
   * Click "Add a certificate or secret"
   * Select "New client secret"
   * Set a description and expiration time
   * Copy the secret's "Value" (not the ID)

## Configure Nhost

1. Go to your project's settings -> Sign In Methods.
2. Find Azure AD, enable it, and enter the client ID and secret.
3. Save your changes.

## User Sign-In

Once you've configured Azure AD as an OAuth provider in Nhost, you can sign in users using the Azure AD provider. See the [OAuth Provider Sign-In Guide](/products/auth/providers/sign-in-provider) for detailed implementation instructions including the complete OAuth flow, error handling, and session management.

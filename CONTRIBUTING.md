# Contributing

Welcome and thank you for considering contributing to Nhost!

This document outlines the rules to follow to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. If you are ever in doubt about anything, we encourage you to reach out [via Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9V7Qb2U).

## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to Nhost repos via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to make sure issues are handled on time, but it could take a while to investigate the root cause depending on the impact. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first-timer's guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) for resources and tips on getting started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with Nhost, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help indicate to our maintainers that a particular problem affects more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

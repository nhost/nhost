description: How to use The Guild's codegen with Nhost
---

You can use [The Guild's codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) to generate types and document nodes for your GraphQL operations and use them directly with Nhost's GraphQL client.

You can find a working example with instructions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/blob/main/examples/guides/codegen-nhost/README.md).

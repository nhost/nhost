If you are using the Nhost CLI for local development, you can also start Graphite locally. To do so, follow the next steps:



  ### Configuring the Service

Follow the steps highlighed in the [Enabling Service](/products/ai/enabling-service) guide and don't forget to add the relevant secrets to your `.secrets` file.


  ### Start nhost

Run `nhost up`:

    ![nhost up](/images/ai/local-development/nhost_up.png)

    After starting the service the first thing you will notice is that there is a new `ai` service running.


  ### Commit metadata changes

As you start the AI service metadata changes may be proposed:

    ![git status](/images/ai/local-development/git_status.png)

    We strongly recommmend you to commit them to your git repository so they can be deployed alongside your application.





### Synhcronizing Auto-Embeddings

If you add [auto-embeddings](/products/ai/auto-embeddings) configuration locally and want to synchronize them with the cloud we recommend inserting them using a migration rather than with the auto-embeddings UI:

![migration](/images/ai/local-development/migration.png)

And then running `nhost up` to download the updated metadata. Afterwards you should see both database migrations and functions' metadata changes in your local project:

![git status](/images/ai/local-development/git_status_functions.png)

Pushing them to your deployment branch will also deploy them to your cloud project.

### Synhcronizing Assistants

Similar to auto-embeddings, if you want to synchronize [assistants](/products/ai/assistants) we recommend you to insert them using a migration and then running `nhost up` to update any metadata if necessary. After pushing the proposed changes to the deployment branch all the changes should be deployed to the cloud project.

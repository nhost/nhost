Nhost Storage is a file storage service seamlessly integrated with the [GraphQL API](/products/graphql) and its [Permission System](/products/graphql/permissions). Files are stored on an S3-compatible backend, metadata is managed through GraphQL, and access control is handled by the same Hasura permission system used for the rest of your data. Files are served through a [CDN](/products/storage/cdn) for optimal performance.

## Client URL

Client URL is the URL of your frontend application. The Client URL is used to redirect the user in certain auth workflows like signing in or resetting a password.

## Allowed Redirect URLs

Allowed Redirect URLs are the URLs of your frontend application that users are allowed to be redirected to on specific auth workflows. This is useful if you have multiple applications using the same Nhost backend or if you want to redirect users to a specific URL after certain authentication workflows.

As an example, for a staging project, you can set the Client URL to `https://staging.example.com` and Allowed Redirect URLs to `https://*.vercel.app`. This way, the user can be redirected to any Vercel deployment of your frontend application.

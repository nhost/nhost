An SMS OTP (one-time password) is a secure authorization method where a numeric or alphanumeric code is sent to a mobile phone number.

Nhost supports OTP via SMS with Twilio.

## Configuration

You need a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) to use this feature because all SMS' are sent through Twilio.

Enable the Phone Number (SMS) sign-in method in the Nhost Dashboard under **Settings -> Sign-In Methods -> Phone Number (SMS)**.

You need to configure the following:

- Account SID
- Auth Token
- Messaging Service SID (or a Twilio phone number)

## Sign In

Signing in users with a phone number is a two-step process:


### Request OTP

The user will receive the OTP on the phone number specified.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
```js
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  phoneNumber: '+11233213123'
})
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Dart">
```dart
await nhost.auth.signIn(
  phoneNumber: '+11233213123'
)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



### Sign In with OTP

To sign in the user, pass in the OTP received on the previous step.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
```js
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  phoneNumber: '+11233213123',
  otp: '123456'
})
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Dart">
```dart
await nhost.auth.signIn(
  phoneNumber: '+11233213123',
  otp: '123456'
)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>




:::note
A user account is created the first time a phone number is used

:::note
Phone numbers should start with `+` (not `00`) to follow the [E.164 formatting standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)

## Create GitLab Account

- Create a new [GitLab Account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up) if you don't have one already.

## Create GitLab OAuth App

- Create a new OAuth application [(direct link)](https://gitlab.com/oauth/applications) by:
   - On the left Sidebar, Select Applications.
   - Select Add new application on the right.
   
## GitLab OAuth App Information.

- Enter a Name and a Redirect URI.
- Select OAuth 2 Scopes as defined in the [Authorized Applications documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/integration/oauth_provider/#view-all-authorized-applications).
  - Minimum required scope:
    `read_user`
  - OAuth 2.0 Application Type:
    `confidential`

- Fill in the **Redirect URI** with your OAuth Callback URL from Nhost.

## Configure Nhost

- Click Generate a new client secret to generate an OAuth client secret.
- Copy and paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from GitLab to your Nhost OAuth settings for GitLab. Make sure the OAuth provider is enabled in Nhost.
- Click the checkbox “**I have pasted the redirect URI into GitLab”**.
- Click **Confirm settings**.

## Sign In Users

Once you've configured GitLab as an OAuth provider in Nhost, you can sign in users using the GitLab provider. See the [OAuth Provider Sign-In Guide](/products/auth/providers/sign-in-provider) for detailed implementation instructions including the complete OAuth flow, error handling, and session management.

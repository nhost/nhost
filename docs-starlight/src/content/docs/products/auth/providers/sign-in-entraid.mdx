6. Create a new client secret:
   * Click "Add a certificate or secret"
   * Select "New client secret"
   * Set a description and expiration time
   * Copy the secret's "Value" (not the ID)

## Configure Nhost

1. Go to your project's settings -> Sign In Methods.
2. Find Entra ID, enable it, and enter the client ID and secret.
3. Save your changes.

## User Sign-In

Once you've configured Entra ID as an OAuth provider in Nhost, you can sign in users using the Entra ID provider. See the [OAuth Provider Sign-In Guide](/products/auth/providers/sign-in-provider) for detailed implementation instructions including the complete OAuth flow, error handling, and session management.

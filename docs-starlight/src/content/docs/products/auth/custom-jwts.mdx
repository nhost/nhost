In some cases you need to act on behalf of a user — for example, to impersonate a user from an admin panel or to generate tokens with custom claims. While the Auth service doesn't support this directly, you can implement it with an Nhost Function.

For the full implementation guide, including the function code, authorization methods, and usage examples, see the [Custom JWTs guide](/products/functions/guides/custom-jwts).

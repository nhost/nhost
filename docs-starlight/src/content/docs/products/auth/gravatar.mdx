## Gravatar

If Gravatar is enabled, Nhost Auth will use the user's email address to fetch their Gravatar profile picture. If the user doesn't have a Gravatar profile picture, a default image will be used.

There are two options for Gravatars.


  ### Default Image

If the user doesn't have a Gravatar profile picture, a default image will be used. You can choose between the following options:

- `404`: Do not load any image if none is associated with the email hash, instead return an HTTP 404 (File Not Found) response.
- `mp`: (mystery-person) a simple, cartoon-style silhouetted outline of a person (does not vary by email hash).
- `identicon`: a geometric pattern based on an email hash.
- `monsterid`: a generated 'monster' with different colors, faces, etc.
- `wavatar`: generated faces with differing features and backgrounds.
- `retro`: awesome generated, 8-bit arcade-style pixelated faces.
- `robohash`: a generated robot with different colors, faces, etc.
- `blank`: a transparent PNG image.



### Rating

Gravatar images are rated by default. You can choose between the following options:

- `g`: suitable for display on all websites with any audience type.
- `pg`: may contain rude gestures, provocatively dressed individuals, lesser swear words or mild violence.
- `r`: may contain such things as harsh profanity, intense violence, nudity, or hard drug use.
- `x`: may contain hardcore sexual imagery or extremely disturbing violence.

Sign In with Email and Password is enabled by default on all projects.

## Sign Up

To Sign Up a new user, use `signUp` with a valid email and password. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
```js
await nhost.auth.signUp({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
})
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Dart">
```dart
await nhost.auth.signUp(
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
When email verification is enabled, a newly registered user will receive an email with a link they must follow in order to verify the email address
:::

## Sign In

After a user is registered, and optionally verified, it is able to Sign In.


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
```js
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
})
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Dart">
```dart
await nhost.auth.signIn(
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Email Verification

By default, newly registered users will receive an email with a verification link they must follow before they can Sign In. 

To change this setting, navigate to **Settings -> Sign-In Methods -> Email and Password** and set **Require Verified Emails**.

It is possible to manually send the verification email to a user with `sendVerificationEmail()`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
```js
await nhost.auth.sendVerificationEmail({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
})
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Dart">
```js
await nhost.auth.sendVerificationEmail(
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

One-Time Passwords (OTPs) are temporary codes for single use that can be delivered to users via email. OTPs expire after 5 minutes and can only be used once. OTPs can provide a more secure and convenient alternative to regular passwords.

To use One-Time Passwords, they need to be enabled in the configuration:

<Tabs>
 <TabItem label="nhost.toml">
 ```toml
 [auth.method.otp.email]
 enabled = true
 ```
 </TabItem>
 <TabItem label="Dashboard">
 ![sign-in otp](/images/auth/sign-in-otp.png)
 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the functionality has been enabled the flow is as follows:

1. User requests an OTP:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="javascript">
  ```js
  nhost.auth.signInOTPEmail({
    email: 'user@example.com'
  })
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="dart">
  ```dart
  nhost.auth.signInEmailOTP(email: "user@example.com");
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. User receives an email with the OTP
3. User enters the OTP

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="javascript">
  ```js
  nhost.auth.verifySignInOTPEmail({
    email: 'user@example.com',
    otp: '123456'
  })
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="dart">
  ```dart
  nhost.auth.verifyEmailOTP(email: "user@example.com", otp: "123456");
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Magic Links are a type of passwordless login that allow users to sign in into their account by clicking a link that is emailed to them, rather than typing in their user and password.

Magic Links are disabled by default and can be enabled using the Nhost Dashboard under **Settings -> Sign-In Methods -> Magic Link**.

## Sign In

To sign in users with a Magic Link, use `signIn` with only an email:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
```js
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'joe@example.com'
})
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Dart">
```dart
await nhost.auth.signIn(
  email: 'joe@example.com'
)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

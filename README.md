**Nhost is a serverless backend for web and mobile apps.** Nhost consists of open
source software pre-configured to make it fast to get started and easy to scale.

This is what you get with Nhost:

- Database: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- GraphQL API: [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)
- Authentication: [Hasura Auth](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth/)
- Storage: [Hasura Storage](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-backend-plus/)
- Functions: [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)/[TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) runtimes

We also provide a UI to manage your database, users, and files. And we have
JS/TS and Flutter SDKs to make it easy to work with.

# Get Started

![Nhost CLI](assets/cli-started.png)

## Managed at Nhost.io

[Sign up](https://console.nhost.io) and create your first app on [https://console.nhost.io](https://console.nhost.io).

![Nhost](assets/get-started.png)

Then connect to your new Nhost app using the [JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://docs.nhost.io/get-started/quick-start/javascript-client) or [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/nhost/nhost-dart).

```bash
$ npm install nhost-js-sdk
# or
$ flutter i nhost-dart-sdk
```

In your project, initialize the SDK with the endpoint of your new Nhost App:

```js
import { createClient } from "nhost-js-sdk";

const nhost = createClient({
  baseURL: "https://project-id.nhost.app",
});

export { nhost };
```

Now you're ready to develop your app.

## What is Nhost?

Nhost is a modern open-source Firebase alternative with the same developer experience on the backend as [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) on the frontend.

Nhost's goal is to provide the **most productive developer experience to build apps**. We use the most popular and powerful technologies and make them easy to use with zero vendor lock-in.

We also provide a **workflow** from your local development, to staging (coming soon), and finally to production. We try to make your life as a developer as efficient as possible.

A Nhost backend includes a PostgreSQL database, a GraphQL API (with Hasura), Authentication, Storage, and Serverless Functions.

## Getting started

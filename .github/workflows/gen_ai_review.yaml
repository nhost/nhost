            Review this pull request with focus on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Performance implications
            - Breaking changes
            - Test coverage
            - Documentation updates needed
            - If there is an existing comment from opencode-agent, update it instead of creating a new one.
            Please provide specific, actionable feedback.
            Do not attempt to push changes, only suggest them in the review.

            Additionally, update the PR description if needed:
            - Summarize key changes
            - Do not suggest description changes in a comment, update the description directly.
            - If there is a description already, improve it rather than replacing it entirely.

            Do not:
            - Duplicate information in the PR description and comments.
            - Make assumptions about the code outside of the diff.
            - Add multiple comments on the same PR

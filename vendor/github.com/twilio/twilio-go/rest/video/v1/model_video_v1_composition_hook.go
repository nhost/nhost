// VideoV1CompositionHook struct for VideoV1CompositionHook

	AccountSid *string `json:"account_sid,omitempty"`
	// The string that you assigned to describe the resource. Can be up to 100 characters long and must be unique within the account.
	FriendlyName *string `json:"friendly_name,omitempty"`
	// Whether the CompositionHook is active. When `true`, the CompositionHook is triggered for every completed Group Room on the account. When `false`, the CompositionHook is never triggered.
	Enabled *bool `json:"enabled,omitempty"`
	// The date and time in GMT when the resource was created specified in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.
	DateCreated *time.Time `json:"date_created,omitempty"`

	Sid *string `json:"sid,omitempty"`
	// The array of track names to include in the compositions created by the composition hook. A composition triggered by the composition hook includes all audio sources specified in `audio_sources` except those specified in `audio_sources_excluded`. The track names in this property can include an asterisk as a wild card character, which matches zero or more characters in a track name. For example, `student*` includes tracks named `student` as well as `studentTeam`. Please, be aware that either video_layout or audio_sources have to be provided to get a valid creation request
	AudioSources *[]string `json:"audio_sources,omitempty"`
	// The array of track names to exclude from the compositions created by the composition hook. A composition triggered by the composition hook includes all audio sources specified in `audio_sources` except for those specified in `audio_sources_excluded`. The track names in this property can include an asterisk as a wild card character, which matches zero or more characters in a track name. For example, `student*` excludes `student` as well as `studentTeam`. This parameter can also be empty.
	AudioSourcesExcluded *[]string `json:"audio_sources_excluded,omitempty"`
	// A JSON object that describes the video layout of the composition in terms of regions as specified in the HTTP POST request that created the CompositionHook resource.

Please, be aware that either video_layout or audio_sources have to be provided to get a valid creation request
	VideoLayout *interface{} `json:"video_layout,omitempty"`
	// The dimensions of the video image in pixels expressed as columns (width) and rows (height). The string's format is `{width}x{height}`, such as `640x480`.
	Resolution *string `json:"resolution,omitempty"`
	// Whether intervals with no media are clipped, as specified in the POST request that created the CompositionHook resource. Compositions with `trim` enabled are shorter when the Room is created and no Participant joins for a while as well as if all the Participants leave the room and join later, because those gaps will be removed. See [Specifying Video Layouts](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/api/compositions-resource#specifying-video-layouts) for more info.
	Trim   *bool   `json:"trim,omitempty"`

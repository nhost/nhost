- 65687bee: Remove `@nhost/react` from `peerDepencencies`

  The contents of the `@nhost/react` package are now exported by `@nhost/nextjs`. As a result,
  It is not required to install `@nhost/react` alongside `@nhost/nextjs`.

  Before:

  ```
  yarn add @nhost/react @nhost/nextjs graphql
  ```

  After:

  ```
  yarn add @nhost/nextjs graphql
  ```

  Closes [#1335](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/issues/1335)

### Patch Changes

- b21222b3: chore(deps): update dependency @types/node to v16
- 54df0df4: Use initial session sent from the server

  When running a SSR page, the session was correctly created from the refresh token on the server side and was sent to the client side, but was not used correctly on the client side.
  As a result, the client was refreshing the access token when loading the page, rather than using the access token sent by the server.
  The client now uses the session sent from the server.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c1613394: Deanonymisation
  Once signed in anonymously, users can deanonymise using `nhost.auth.deanonymize`.
  Deanonymisation works the same way as email+password sign-up or passwordless sign-in. The related methods, hooks in React and composables in Vue can therefore be used for deanonymising users, such as `nhost.auth.signUp`, `useSignUpEmailPassword`, and `useSignInEmailPasswordless`.

  - @nhost/nhost-js@1.3.0
  - @nhost/react@0.8.0

## 1.2.13

### Patch Changes

- 08a37aae: correct rewriting options when `clientUrl` is not available
  The client URL is set to `window.location.origin`, so it can rewrite redirection urls that are passed on to authenticaion methods. However, `clientUrl` is set to `''` when running on the server side. This fix then avoid raising an error when trying to rewrite `redirectTo` on non-browser environment, and forces `useProviderLink` to be rendered on the client side.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 58fa2a2: Improve loading status
  The `loading` status indicates the authentication is not yet known to the client when it starts. Once the client is ready, the authentication status is either signed in, or signed out.
  When the user was trying to authenticate, the `loading` status was set to `true` until the result of the authentication was known.
  The client now only return `loading: true` on startup, and in no other cases.
- 58fa2a2: Look for a valid refresh token both the URL and local storage
  When auto-signin was activated, the client was not taking into account the refresh token in the URL if a token was already stored locally.
  The user was then not able to authenticate from a link when the refresh token stored locally was invalid or expired.
  When auto-signin is activated, the client now checks and tries tokens from both the URL and the local storage, starting with the URL.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7b23d33: Get the refresh token in the right place in the url
  Hasura-auth puts the refresh token in the url as `refreshToken`, but it is not stored using the same key in localStorage / the cookie. This fix makes the right correspondance between the two.
  - @nhost/nhost-js@1.1.6
  - @nhost/react@0.6.1

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b52b4fc: Introduce `createServerSideNhostClient`
  Until now, the Nhost client was not functionning correctly on the server side.
  The `createServerSideNhostClient` can be called inside the `getServerSideProps` function of a page.
  When called, it will try to get the refesh token in cookies, or from the request URL.
  If a refresh token is found, it uses it to get an up to date access token (JWT) and a user session
  This method returns a promise of an `NhostClient` and resolves only when the authentication status is known eventually.

  `getNhostSession` now uses the above method under the hood to extract the user session and hydrate the NhostClient context on the client side.

- 616e320: Look for the refresh token both in the query parameters and in the hash
  Until now, after redirecting from an email, Hasura-auth puts refresh tokens in the hash part of the url. It is a problem when using SSR as the hash is not accessible to the server. This behaviour is likely to change. As a result, the client now parses both the hash and the query parameters of the url.
  See [this issue](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth/issues/148) to keep track of the progress on Hasura-auth.

### Patch Changes

- 49545c0: Remove filtering of `useLayoutEffect` from logs
  The `suppressConsoleMessage` method was meant to suppress incorrect `useLayoutEffect` messages raised on Nextjs server-side renderings. Its implementation had an impact on the normal functionning of logging (see [#447](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/issues/447)).
  This filtering was necessary when using former versions of xstate and can now be removed.

- 744fd69: Introducing `useSendVerificationEmail`

  While `useSignInEmailPassword` automatically sends a verification email (when the backend is configured to do so), an user may sometime want to request for an verification email to be sent again. See the [documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react/hooks#send-email-verification) for further information about how to use this hook.

- 744fd69: Rename hooks and their methods to make them more explicit

  - `useEmailPasswordlessSignIn`
    - Hook renamed to `useSignInEmailPasswordless`
    - `signIn` renamed to `signInEmailPasswordless`
  - `useEmailPasswordSignIn`

    - Hook renamed to `useSignInEmailPassword`
    - `signIn` renamed to `signInEmailPassword`
    - `needsVerification` renamed to `needsEmailVerification`

  - `useEmailPasswordSignUp`

    - Hook renamed to `useSignUpEmailPassword`
    - `signUp` renamed to `signUpEmailPassword`
    - `needsVerification` renamed to `needsEmailVerification`

  - `useAnonymousSignIn`

    - Hook renamed to `useSignInAnonymous`
    - renamed `signIn` to `signInAnonymous`

  - `useChangeEmail`

    - `needsVerification` renamed to `needsEmailVerification`

- 744fd69: Introducing `useSignInAnonymous`

  Anonymous Sign-In is a feature that allows users to get a temporary id without attaching yet any personal information such as an email or a passowrd.

  Anonymous users can then run GraphQL operations, with a specific `public` role that is distinct from the default `user` role. The anonymous can then "deanonymize" their account at a later stage in attaching the missing registration information and an authentication method.

  **Note** Anonymous Sign-In is not available out of the box yet in the [Nhost cloud](https://app.nhost.io/), but will be available in the near future.

  **Note 2** The deanonymisation process is not yet available. This is also part of our roadmap.

  ```js
  const { signInAnonymous, isLoading, isSuccess, isError, error } = useSignInAnonymous()
  ```

  const Component = () => {
    const { signInAnonymous, isSuccess } = useSignInAnonymous(email, password)
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={signInAnonymous}>Anonymous sign-in</button>
        {isSuccess && <div>You are now signed in anonymously</div>}
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

- 744fd69: Add options to `useProviderLink`

  Since [Hasura Auth version 0.4](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth/releases/tag/v0.4.0), it is possible to pass on options when signing up or signin in through an OAuth provider. It is now possible to determine these options in the `useProviderLink`, so it generates the right URL when using the provider links.

  See the [React documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react/hooks#oauth-providers) for additional information.

- 744fd69: Time-based One-Time Password Multi-Factor Authentication

  **Note** MFA is not available out of the box yet in the [Nhost cloud](https://app.nhost.io/), but will be available in the near future.

  When enabled in the backend, users that signed up with an email and a password can opt-in for an additional authentication security measure.
  MFA can be activated in using the new `useConfigMfa` hook.

  Two methods has been also added to `useEmailPasswordSignIn`: when MFA is active, authentication won't be a success straight after signin up with an email and a password.
  The new `needsMfaOtp` will then appear as `true`, and the authentication will succeed only when the user will have sent back the OTP code with `sendMfaOtp(code:string)`.

  ```js
  const { generateQrCode, isGenerating, isGenerated, qrCodeDataUrl, activateMfa, isActivating, isActivated, isError, error } =
    useConfigMfa(code?: string)
  ```

- 744fd69: Unify vanilla, react and next APIs so they can work together
  React and NextJS libraries now works together with `@nhost/nhost-js`. It also means the Nhost client needs to be initiated before passing it to the React provider.
  See the [React](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react#configuration) and [NextJS](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/nextjs/configuration) configuration documentation for additional information.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [744fd69]
  - @nhost/react@0.3.0
  - @nhost/nhost-js@1.0.0

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 9bd01e7: Export refresh function

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d8afde: Use `@nhost/react` as a peer dependency
  `@nhost/react` was bundled where it shouldn't. As a result, `@nhost/react-apollo` did not have access to the Nhost React context, leading to errors

### Patch Changes

- 0d8afde: Bump xstate version 4.30.5
- 0d8afde: Capture the Nextjs/xstate warning about useLayoutEffect
  When using Xstate on the server side, Nextjs raises a warning about the use of `useLayoutEffect` whereas xstate is actually using an isomorphic version of layout effects. Such warnings are now captured.
- Updated dependencies [0d8afde]
  - @nhost/react@0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 207ae38: New NextJS client

  Introducting a new `@nhost/nextjs` package. It is designed to keep the refresh token between the browser and the Next.js server with a cookie. SSR routes should fetch the session in `getServerSideProps` into a `nhostSession` pageProps in using the `getNhostSession` method.

  Every `@nhost/react` hook is compatible with this package.

  See the [documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/nextjs) for further information.

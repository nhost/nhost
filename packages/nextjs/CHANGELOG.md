### Minor Changes

- 744fd69: Introducing `useSendVerificationEmail`

  While `useSignInEmailPassword` automatically sends a verification email (when the backend is configured to do so), an user may sometime want to request for an verification email to be sent again. See the [documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react/hooks#send-email-verification) for further information about how to use this hook.

- 744fd69: Rename hooks and their methods to make them more explicit

  - `useEmailPasswordlessSignIn`
    - Hook renamed to `useSignInEmailPasswordless`
    - `signIn` renamed to `signInEmailPasswordless`
  - `useEmailPasswordSignIn`

    - Hook renamed to `useSignInEmailPassword`
    - `signIn` renamed to `signInEmailPassword`
    - `needsVerification` renamed to `needsEmailVerification`

  - `useEmailPasswordSignUp`

    - Hook renamed to `useSignUpEmailPassword`
    - `signUp` renamed to `signUpEmailPassword`
    - `needsVerification` renamed to `needsEmailVerification`

  - `useAnonymousSignIn`

    - Hook renamed to `useSignInAnonymous`
    - renamed `signIn` to `signInAnonymous`

  - `useChangeEmail`

    - `needsVerification` renamed to `needsEmailVerification`

- 744fd69: Introducing `useSignInAnonymous`

  Anonymous Sign-In is a feature that allows users to get a temporary id without attaching yet any personal information such as an email or a passowrd.

  Anonymous users can then run GraphQL operations, with a specific `public` role that is distinct from the default `user` role. The anonymous can then "deanonymize" their account at a later stage in attaching the missing registration information and an authentication method.

  **Note** Anonymous Sign-In is not available out of the box yet in the [Nhost cloud](https://app.nhost.io/), but will be available in the near future.

  **Note 2** The deanonymisation process is not yet available. This is also part of our roadmap.

  ```js
  const { signInAnonymous, isLoading, isSuccess, isError, error } = useSignInAnonymous()
  ```

  #### Usage

  ```jsx
  import { useSignInAnonymous } from '@nhost/react'

  const Component = () => {
    const { signInAnonymous, isSuccess } = useSignInAnonymous(email, password)
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={signInAnonymous}>Anonymous sign-in</button>
        {isSuccess && <div>You are now signed in anonymously</div>}
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

- 744fd69: Add options to `useProviderLink`

  Since [Hasura Auth version 0.4](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth/releases/tag/v0.4.0), it is possible to pass on options when signing up or signin in through an OAuth provider. It is now possible to determine these options in the `useProviderLink`, so it generates the right URL when using the provider links.

  See the [React documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react/hooks#oauth-providers) for additional information.

- 744fd69: Time-based One-Time Password Multi-Factor Authentication

  **Note** MFA is not available out of the box yet in the [Nhost cloud](https://app.nhost.io/), but will be available in the near future.

  When enabled in the backend, users that signed up with an email and a password can opt-in for an additional authentication security measure.
  MFA can be activated in using the new `useConfigMfa` hook.

  Two methods has been also added to `useEmailPasswordSignIn`: when MFA is active, authentication won't be a success straight after signin up with an email and a password.
  The new `needsMfaOtp` will then appear as `true`, and the authentication will succeed only when the user will have sent back the OTP code with `sendMfaOtp(code:string)`.

  ```js
  const { generateQrCode, isGenerating, isGenerated, qrCodeDataUrl, activateMfa, isActivating, isActivated, isError, error } =
    useConfigMfa(code?: string)
  ```

  | `isGenerating`   | boolean                                                       | Returns `true` if the QR code is generating but not yet available                                               |
  | `isGenerated`    | boolean                                                       | Returns `true` when the QR code has been successfully generated and is available                                |
  | `qrCodeDataUrl`  | string                                                        | Returns the QR code as a [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) |

  | `isActivated`    | boolean                                                       | Returns `true` when MFA has been successfully activated                                                         |

  #### Usage

  ```jsx
  import { useConfigMfa } from '@nhost/react'
  import { useState } from 'react'

  export const Mfa: React.FC = () => {
    const [code, setCode] = useState('')
    const { generateQrCode, activateMfa, isActivated, isGenerated, qrCodeDataUrl } =
      useConfigMfa(code)

    return (
      <div>
        {!isGenerated && (
          <button block appearance="primary" onClick={generateQrCode}>
            Generate
          </button>
        )}
        {isGenerated && !isActivated && (
          <div>
            <img alt="qrcode" src={qrCodeDataUrl} />
            <input value={code} onChange={onChange={(event) => setCode(event.target.value)}} placeholder="Enter activation code" />
            <button block appearance="primary" onClick={activateMfa}>
              Activate
            </button>
          </div>
        )}
        {isActivated && <div>MFA has been activated!!!</div>}
      </div>
    )
  }

  ```

- 744fd69: Unify vanilla, react and next APIs so they can work together
  React and NextJS libraries now works together with `@nhost/nhost-js`. It also means the Nhost client needs to be initiated before passing it to the React provider.
  See the [React](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react#configuration) and [NextJS](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/nextjs/configuration) configuration documentation for additional information.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 9bd01e7: Export refresh function

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d8afde: Use `@nhost/react` as a peer dependency
  `@nhost/react` was bundled where it shouldn't. As a result, `@nhost/react-apollo` did not have access to the Nhost React context, leading to errors

### Patch Changes

- 0d8afde: Bump xstate version 4.30.5
- 0d8afde: Capture the Nextjs/xstate warning about useLayoutEffect
  When using Xstate on the server side, Nextjs raises a warning about the use of `useLayoutEffect` whereas xstate is actually using an isomorphic version of layout effects. Such warnings are now captured.
- Updated dependencies [0d8afde]
  - @nhost/react@0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 207ae38: New NextJS client

  Introducting a new `@nhost/nextjs` package. It is designed to keep the refresh token between the browser and the Next.js server with a cookie. SSR routes should fetch the session in `getServerSideProps` into a `nhostSession` pageProps in using the `getNhostSession` method.

  Every `@nhost/react` hook is compatible with this package.

  See the [documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/nextjs) for further information.

  Closes [#110](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/issues/110) and [#180](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/issues/180)

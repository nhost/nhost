## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 744fd69: Use `@nhost/react` instead of `@nhost/react-auth`
  This major release allows to use the latest Nhost authentication state mechanism. It wraps and exports `NhostReactProvider` as `NhostAuthProvider` and `useNhostAuth` from `@nhost/react`.

  In order to use it, you need to install `@nhost/react` as it is now a peer dependency:

  ```
  npm install @nhost/react
  # or
  yarn add @nhost/react
  ```

  It is however recommended to switch to `@nhost/react` and to remove this package from your dependencies.

### Minor Changes

- 744fd69: Unify vanilla, react and next APIs so they can work together
  React and NextJS libraries now works together with `@nhost/nhost-js`. It also means the Nhost client needs to be initiated before passing it to the React provider.
  See the [React](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react#configuration) and [NextJS](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/nextjs/configuration) configuration documentation for additional information.

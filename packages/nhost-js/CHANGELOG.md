  import gql from 'graphql-tag'

  const QUERY = gql`
    query {
      books {
        id
        title
      }

## 1.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 2c97db6: Keep authentication status and access token in sync
  The authentication events where not set correctly, leading the main Nhost client not to update internal states of storage/graphql/functions sub-clients when using non-react clients.
  The use of private fields (`#`) is also avoided as they conflict with the use of proxies in Vue, leading to errors in the upcoming Vue library.
  Fixes #373 and #378

### Major Changes

- 744fd69: Use `@nhost/core` and its state machine

  `@nhost/nhost-js` and `@nhost/hasura-auth-js` now use the xstate-based state management system from `@nhost/core`.

  The client initiation remains the same, although the `clientStorage` and `clientStorageType` are deprecated in favor of `clientStorageGetter (key:string) => string | null | Promise<string | null>` and `clientStorageSetter: (key: string, value: string | null) => void | Promise<void>`.

### Minor Changes

- 744fd69: Unify vanilla, react and next APIs so they can work together
  React and NextJS libraries now works together with `@nhost/nhost-js`. It also means the Nhost client needs to be initiated before passing it to the React provider.
  See the [React](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react#configuration) and [NextJS](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/nextjs/configuration) configuration documentation for additional information.

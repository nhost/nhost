/**
 * Session management module for Nhost authentication
 *
 * This module exports utilities for managing authentication sessions across
 * different environments and storage backends. It provides:
 *
 * - Session storage abstractions for different environments
 * - Session persistence and synchronization
 * - Automatic token refresh mechanisms
 *
 * This is an advanced submodule of the Nhost SDK, primarily used internally but it is exposed
 * for advanced use cases.

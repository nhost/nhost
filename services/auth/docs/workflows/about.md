For the sake of readability, some elements are not present in the sequence diagrams:

- Detailed tasks
- Handling of errors
- Payload validation
- The notation of HTTP redirections is simplified: instead of going from the server to the client, then from the client to the redirection, they are presented as going from the server to the redirection

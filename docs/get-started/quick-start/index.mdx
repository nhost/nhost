title: "Create your app"
---

Let's create a simple todo app using Nhost. In a todo app, a user should be able to create list items for their account (CRUD), and not have anyone else see them (permissions).

To implement an app like this on Nhost, we'll briefly cover these topics:

- Creating a new app on nhost
- Defining a database schema
- Inserting data
- Setting permissions
- Querying data via a GraphQL API

By the end of it, you will hopefully have a better understanding of what Nhost is and what it does for you.

## Log in to Nhost

Go to [app.nhost.io](https://app.nhost.io) and sign up for a new account, if you don't have one already. Creating an account is completely free.

Log in to land on Nhost Console.

## Create app

On the console's home page, press the **"New App"** button. Choose a name and pick the region closest to your users.

You'll be all set with the Default Workspace and the Free plan for now.

Setting up a new app will take around 20 seconds or so. During this time, Nhost will set up the entire infrastructure for your app.

Once the setup completes, you'll automatically see the app dashboard, and you're ready to define your app's database schema.

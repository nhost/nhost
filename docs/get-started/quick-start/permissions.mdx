title: "Set permissions"
---

Hasura supports role-based access control. You create rules for each role, table and operation (select, insert, update and delete) that can check dynamic session variables, like user ID.

In the previous section you were able to fetch the todos because the **admin** role is enabled by default when using Hasura Console. When building your applications, you will want to define permissions by using roles that your users can assume when making requests.

## Unauthenticated users

When you want some data to be accessed by anyone without being signed in, use the `public` role in permissions. This is the default role in all unauthenticated requests.

Generally speaking, the `public` role should not have insert, update or delete permissions defined.

### Setting `public` permissions

In Hasura Console, go to the **Data** tab, click on the **todos** table, then click **Permissions**. Add a new role called `public` and click on **select**. The permission options for the select operation will open below.

Add the following permissions:

![Public role](/images/quick-start/permissions-public-select.png)

If you now run the program again, you should now see todos in the output:

```sh
âžœ node index.js

{
  "todos": [
    {
      "id": "558b9754-bb18-4abd-83d9-e9056934e812",
      "created_at": "2021-12-01T17:05:09.311362+00:00",
      "name": "write docs",
      "is_completed": false
    },
    {
      "id": "480369c8-6f57-4061-bfdf-9ead647e10d3",
      "created_at": "2021-12-01T17:05:20.5693+00:00",
      "name": "cook dinner",
      "is_completed": true
    }
  ]
}
```

There are 2 reasons why the request succeeded:

1. Nhost sets the `public` role for every unauthenticated GraphQL request.
2. You explicitly defined permissions for the `public` role.

It is important to understand that Hasura has a **allow nothing by default** policy to make sure that only roles and permissions you define explicitly, are actually available.

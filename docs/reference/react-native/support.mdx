<Note>
  Since React Native is based on React, you can utilize any hook from our [React
  SDK](/reference/re*act/nhost-client) to communicate with your Nhost backend project. However,
  please note that **WebAuthn is currently not supported** in React Native when using these hooks.

# Polyfilling Missing Base64 Decode

In an environment like React Native (running JSCore) that does not support `atob` or `btoa`, a polyfill is needed. Follow these steps to implement the polyfill and enable full compatibility with the Nhost SDK

1. Install `base-64`:

   ```sh
   npm install base-64
   ```

2. In the `index.js` file, which is the entry point for React Native applications, add the following import and global assignment:

   ```diff
   ...
   + import {decode as atob} from 'base-64';
   + global.atob = atob;
   AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
   ```

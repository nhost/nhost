<Note>
  Since React Native is based on React, you can utilize any hook from our [React
  SDK](/reference/react/nhost-client) to communicate with your Nhost backend project. However,
  please note that **WebAuthn is currently not supported** in React Native when using these hooks.

# Polyfill Missing Base64 Decode

In an environment like React Native (running JSCore) that does not support `atob` or `btoa`, a polyfill is needed.
Follow these steps to implement the polyfill and enable full compatibility with the Nhost SDK

1. Install `base-64`:

   ```sh Terminal
   npm install base-64
   ```

2. In the `index.js` file, which is the entry point for React Native applications, add the following import and global assignment:

   ```tsx index.js
   import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
   import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
   import App from './src/root';
   import { name as appName } from './app.json';
   import { decode as atob } from 'base-64'; // Import decode function
   global.atob = atob; // Assign atob to global for polyfill

   AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
   ```

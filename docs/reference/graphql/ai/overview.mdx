When deploying graphite, Nhost's AI service, three sets of queries and mutations are deployed:


1. Queries and mutations with the prefix `graphite`, for instance, `graphiteAutoEmbeddingsConfiguration`. These queries and mutations interact with data and can be used normally as any other graphql query or mutation generated by hasura.
2. Queries and mutations with the prefix `_graphite`, for instance `_graphiteAssistant`. These queries are private and shouldn't be used.
3. Queries and mutations inside the namespace `graphite`. For instance:
```graphql
query {
  graphite {
    assistants {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
These queries are provided by `graphite`'s remote schema and are documented in this section.

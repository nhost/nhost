This reference section is home to both backend services and the various client libraries available. 

## Backend Services

In this section you will find the API reference for both the authentication and storage services. There is an **API Playground** to help you learn and test the endpoints against a local Nhost instance.

To learn how to start a local Nhost instance check out [local development](/development/cli/overview). Starting a local instance is optional and only required if you want to use the playground to simulate real requests.

## Client Libraries

This section documents the APIs for all available client libraries:

- `@nhost/nhost-js`
- `@nhost/react`
- `@nhost/nextjs`
- `@nhost/vue`

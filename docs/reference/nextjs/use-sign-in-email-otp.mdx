Use the hook `useSignInEmailOTP` to sign in a user with a one-time password sent via email.

## Usage

1. Call the `signInEmailOTP` function with the user's email to send a one-time password (OTP) to that email address.
2. The state `needsOtp` will be `true`, indicating that an OTP is required.
3. Once the user receives the OTP via email, call the `verifyEmailOTP` function with the email and the received OTP.
4. On successful verification, the user is authenticated, and `isSuccess` becomes `true`.

Any error is monitored through `isError` and `error`. While the `signInEmailOTP` and `verifyEmailOTP` actions are running, `isLoading` equals `true`.

```tsx
const { signInEmailOTP, verifyEmailOTP, isLoading, isSuccess, isError, error } =
  useSignInEmailOTP()

const signIn = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  await signInEmailOTP('john@gmail.com')
}

const verify = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  await verifyEmailOTP('123456')
}
```

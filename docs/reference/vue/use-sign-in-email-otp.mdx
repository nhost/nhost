Use the `useSignInEmailOTP` composable to sign in a user with a one-time password sent via email.

## Usage

1. Call the `signInEmailOTP` function with the user's email to send a one-time password (OTP) to that email address.
2. The state `needsOtp` will be `true`, indicating that an OTP is required.
3. Once the user receives the OTP via email, call the `verifyEmailOTP` function with the email and the received OTP.
4. On successful verification, the user is authenticated, and `isSuccess` becomes `true`.

Any errors during the sign-in or verification process are tracked using `isError` and `error`. While the `signInEmailOTP` and `verifyEmailOTP` actions are in progress, `isLoading` is `true`.

## Example

```ts
const { signInEmailOTP, verifyEmailOTP, error } = useSignInEmailOTP()

const requestOtp = async (e: Event) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  await signInEmailOTP(email.value)
}

const confirmOtp = async (e: Event) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  await verifyEmailOTP(email.value, otp.value)
}
```

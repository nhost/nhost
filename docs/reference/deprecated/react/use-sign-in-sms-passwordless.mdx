Use the hook `useSignInSmsPasswordless` to sign in a user with a one-time password sent via SMS to a phone.

1. The `signInSmsPasswordless` action sends a one-time password to the given phone number.
2. The client is then awaiting the OTP. `needsOtp` equals true.
3. After the code is received by SMS, the client sends the code with `sendOtp`. On success, the client is authenticated, and `isSuccess` equals `true`.

Any error is monitored through `isError` and `error`. While the `signInSmsPasswordless` and `sendOtp` actions are running, `isLoading` equals `true`.

```tsx
const {
  signInSmsPasswordless,
  sendOtp,
  needsOtp,
  isLoading,
  isSuccess,
  isError,
  error
} = useSignInSmsPasswordless()

console.log({ isLoading, isSuccess, isError, error })

const askCode = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  await signInSmsPasswordless('+32455555555')
}

const sendCode = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  await sendOtp('123456')
}
```

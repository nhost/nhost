Use `nhost.auth.getAuthenticationStatus` to get the authentication status of the user.

If `isLoading` is `true`, the client doesn't know whether the user is authenticated yet or not
because some internal authentication network requests have not been resolved yet.

The `connectionAttempts` returns the number of times the client has tried to connect to the server with no success (offline, or the server retruned an internal error).

```ts
const { isAuthenticated, isLoading } = nhost.auth.getAuthenticationStatus()

if (isLoading) {
  console.log('Loading...')
}

if (isAuthenticated) {
  console.log('User is authenticated')
}
```

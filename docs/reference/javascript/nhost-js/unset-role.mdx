Use `nhost.unsetRole` to unset the user role for all subsequent graphql, storage and functions calls.
Underneath, this method removes the `x-hasura-role` header from the graphql, storage and functions clients.

Note: Exercise caution when mixing the use of `unsetRole` along with `setHeaders` when setting the
`x-hasura-role` header, as the last call will override any previous ones.

```ts
nhost.unsetRole()
```

It is possible to use [`@nhost/react`](/reference/react) in any Next.js page that would be configured to render on the client-side.

When rendering a page from the server-side, Next.js needs to get some information from the client to determine their authentication status. Such communication is only available from cookies, and the Nhost client is designed to enable such a mechanism.

The cookie is `same-site` and is used only to store the refresh cookie and the expiration date of the JWT so the browser can proactively ask for a new JWT before it expires.

## Signing in

There is no need to activate SSR on the sign-in page as there is no session information to capture. As a result, it is recommended to code it as a classic static page.

The initial authentication would then work like this diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser as Browser
    participant next as Next.js
    participant auth as Hasura Auth
    browser->>auth: Authenticate
    activate browser
    activate auth
    auth-->>browser: New refresh token + JWT + user data
    deactivate auth
    browser->>browser: Set the new refresh token in the cookie
    deactivate browser
```

## Refreshing the JWT token

For security considerations, the Nhost JS tools never persist the JWT anywhere in the browser either in `localStorage` or in a cookie, and the JWT expires regularly (15 minutes by default). As a result, the Nhost client regularly calls the `hasura-auth` service to get a new JWT from a valid refresh token. The new JWT is emitted together with a new refresh token, while the old one is invalidated.
As a result, it is important to ensure both the browser and the Next.js will always use the last refresh token, as it will be the only one that is still valid.
The above diagram illustrates how a JWT is renewed, while making sure the refresh token is updated:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser as Browser
    participant next as Next.js
    participant auth as Hasura Auth
    browser->>auth: Initial refresh token
    activate auth
    activate browser
    auth-->>browser: New refresh token + JWT + user data
    deactivate auth
    browser->>browser: Set the new refresh token in the cookie
    deactivate browser
```

## Loading a SSR page

When Nhost is activated on a specific page, the Next.js server will first check the refresh token in the cookie. If it is present, it will call the `hasura-auth` service to refresh the JWT, user data and the new refresh cookie.
It then:

- sets the new refresh cookie in the response headers
- hydrates the page with user data and JWT
- renders the page on the server side. At this stage, an authenticated GraphQL call can be done on the server-side as a valid JWT is available

Once the SSR page is loaded, it is still possible to refetch data from Hasura as the JWT will then be available in the browser, and kept up to date as explained in the above diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser as Browser
    participant next as Next.js
    participant auth as Hasura Auth
    participant hasura as Hasura
    browser->>next: Request SSR page (refresh token in cookie)
    activate browser
    activate next
    next->>auth: Refresh token
    activate auth
    auth-->>next: New refresh token + JWT + user data
    deactivate auth
    next->>next: Set the new refresh token in the cookie
    next->>next: getServerSideProps - Hydrate JWT + user data
    next->>hasura: GraphQL operation with JWT
    activate hasura
    hasura-->>next: GraphQL data
    deactivate hasura
    next->>next: Render page
    next-->>browser: HTML with the new refresh token in the cookie, and JWT + user data
    deactivate next
    deactivate browser
    browser->>hasura: Refetch data with JWT
    activate browser
    activate hasura
    hasura-->>browser: Updated data
    deactivate hasura
    browser->>browser: Re-render data
    deactivate browser
```

## Loading a static page

It is still possible to use the Nhost SDK in a more classic 'React' mode. It will then be handled in a very similar way, except that the refresh token will be stored in the cookie instead of `localStorage`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser as Browser
    participant next as Next.js
    participant auth as Hasura Auth
    participant hasura as Hasura
    browser->>next: Request static page (refresh token in the cookie)
    activate browser
    activate next
    next-->>browser: Static page (same cookie)
    deactivate next
    browser->>browser: Render "loading data" page
    browser->>hasura: GraphQL operation with JWT
    activate hasura
    hasura-->>browser: GraphQL data
    deactivate hasura
    browser->>browser: Render data
    deactivate browser
```

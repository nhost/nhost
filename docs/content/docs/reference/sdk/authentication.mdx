## nhost.auth.signIn()

Sign in a user with one of the following methods:

- Email and Password
- Passwordless Email (Magic Link)
- Passwordless SMS
- OAuth Provider

If the user does not exist, the user is created. Only exception is when using Email and Password. To sign in a user with Email and password a user first must sign up.

### Examples

#### Sign in with Email and Password

```js
const { session, mfa, error } = await nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'username@gmail.com',
  password: 'my-secret-password'
})
```

### Sign in with Passwordless Email (Magic link)

An email will be sent to the user's email with a link. When the user clicks on the link the user will be automatically redirected and signed-in to your app.

```js
const { error } = await nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'username@gmail.com'
})
```

### Sign in with Passwordless SMS

Start the sign-in process for a user using SMS. This will send a One-time Password (OTP) to the user:

```js
const { session, error } = await nhost.auth.signIn({
  phoneNumber: '+46123456789'
})
```

To verify the phone number and to sign in the user, combine the phone number and the OTP for the user:

```js
const { session, error } = await nhost.auth.signIn({
  phoneNumber: '+46123456789',
  otp: '<otp-from-sms>'
})
```

### Sign in with OAuth Provider

The following providers are available:

- `google`
- `github`
- `facebook`
- `spotify`

```js
const { session, providerUrl, provider, error } = await nhost.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'google'
})
```

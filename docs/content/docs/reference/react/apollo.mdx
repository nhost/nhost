title: 'Apollo GraphQL'
---

## Installation

With Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @nhost/react @nhost/react-apollo
```

With Npm:

```sh
npm install @nhost/react @nhost/react-apollo
```

## Configuration

Let's add a `NhostApolloProvider`. Make sure the Apollo Provider is nested into `NhostProvider`, as it will need the Nhost context to determine the authentication headers to be sent to the GraphQL endpoint.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'
import { NhostApolloProvider } from '@nhost/react-apollo'
import { NhostProvider } from '@nhost/react'
import { Nhost } from '@nhost/client'

const nhost = new Nhost({
  backendUrl: 'http://localhost:1337'
})

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostProvider nhost={nhost}>
      <NhostApolloProvider>
        <App />
      </NhostApolloProvider>
    </NhostProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

## Usage

All the [Apollo hooks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/) will work together with the right authentication status, for any operation - queries, mutations, and subscriptions over websockets.

As an example:

```jsx
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'
import { useAuthenticated } from '@nhost/react'

const GET_BOOKS = gql`
  query Books {
    books {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`
export const BooksQuery = () => {
  const isAuthenticated = useAuthenticated()
  const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(GET_BOOKS)
  if (!isAuthenticated) return <div>You must be authenticated to see this page</div>
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (error) return <div>Error in the query {error.message}</div>
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data?.books.map((book) => (
          <li key={book.id}>{book.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Hooks

### `useAuthQuery`

Works exactly as the original Apollo's [`useQuery`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/#usequery) except the query will be skipped if the user is not authenticated.

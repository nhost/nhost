## Installation

With Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @nhost/react
```

With Npm:

```sh
npm install @nhost/react
```

## Configuration

`@nhost/react` exports a React provider `NhostProvider` that makes the authentication state and the several hooks available in your application. Wrap this component around your whole App.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import { NhostProvider } from '@nhost/react'
import { Nhost } from '@nhost/client'

import App from './App'

const nhost = new Nhost({
  backendUrl: 'http://localhost:1337'
})

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostProvider nhost={nhost}>
      <App />
    </NhostProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

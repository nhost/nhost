Every Nhost app comes with a Postgres database. Postgres is the world's most advanced open-source relational database and the most popular SQL database among developers. The database is hosted with Amazon RDS.

Tables are managed in the Hasura Console.

#### Schemas

You should use the `public` schema when developing your app. `auth` and `storage` are reserved for system functionality like user and file management. You are allowed to modify permissions for tables in the `auth` and `storage` schemas, however.

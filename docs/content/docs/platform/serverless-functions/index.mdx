title: 'Creating functions'
---

Nhost gives you the option to run serverless functions on the following runtimes:

- `Node.js 14` (Both JavaScript and Typescript)

---

## Creating functions

Every `.js` and `.ts` file in the `functions/` folder of your Nhost app will be exposed as an HTTP endpoint. You have to

```js
// In functions/hello/[name].js
export default (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

Or, if you prefer TypeScript:

```ts
// In functions/hello/[name].ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express'

export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

---

## Routing

HTTP endpoints are automatically generated based on the file structure under `functions/`.

As such, given this file structure:

```js
functions / index.js
users / index.ts
active.ts
my - company.js
```

The following endpoints will be available:

- https://yourappid.nhost.run/v1/functions/ - (functions/index.js)
- https://yourappid.nhost.run/v1/functions/users - (functions/users/index.ts)
- https://yourappid.nhost.run/v1/functions/users/active - (functions/users/active.ts)
- https://yourappid.nhost.run/v1/functions/my-company - (functions/my-company.js)

If you've used Netlify or Vercel, this routing logic will be familiar to you.

## Infrastructure

In production, serverless functions are deployed on AWS Lambda.

When developing locally, you must have the correct runtime installed on your machine.

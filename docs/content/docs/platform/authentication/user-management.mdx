title: 'User management'
---

Users are saved in the database in the `auth.users` table and are accessible via the GraphQL API.

---

## Querying users

Example of getting all users in GraphQL:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    displayName
    email
  }
}
```

Example of getting one user in GraphQL:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "some-user-id") {
    id
    displayName
    email
  }
}
```

## Creating users

Users should be created using the sign-up or sign-in flows as described under [sign-in methods](./sign-in-methods).

**Never** create users directly via GraphQL or database. **Never** modify the `auth.users` table. **Never** modify the GraphQL root queries.

You can update the permissions of the `auth.users` table.

---

## Roles

Each user can have one or multiple roles for API requests. You can see the roles of a user and set a default role in Nhost Console under **Users**.

Every GraphQL request is made with a specific role. This role will be used to resolve permissions when querying the database. In other words, every user can have multiple roles, but only one role will be applied for any given GraphQL request.

### Defaults

For new apps, the following roles are available:

- Available roles: `user` and `me`
- Default role: `user`

### Public role

If the user is not signed in, the `public` role will be used.

### Set request role in GraphQL

When no request role is specified, the user's default role will be used:

```js
await nhost.graphql.request(QUERY, {})
```

Make a GraphQL request with the `me` role:

```js
await nhost.graphql.request(
  QUERY,
  {},
  {
    headers: {
      'x-hasura-role': 'me'
    }
  }
)
```

If the request is not part of the user's roles, the request will fail.

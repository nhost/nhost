title: 'Metadata and Serverless Functions'
---

In the previous section, we only created a new table; `customers`. Using the CLI you can also do changes to other parts of your backend.

There are three things the CLI and the GitHub integration track and applies to production:

1. Database migrations
2. Hasura Metadata
3. Serverless Functions

For this section, let’s do one change to the Hasura metadata and create one serverless function

### Hasura Metadata

We’ll add permissions to the `users` table, making sure users can only see their own data. For this, go to the `auth` schema and click on the `users` table. then click on **Permissions** and enter a new role **user** and create a new **select** permission for that role**.**

Create the permission **with custom check**:

```json
{
  "id": {
    "_eq" : "X-Hasura-User-Id"
  }
}
```

Select the following columns:

- id
- created_at
- display_name
- avatar_url
- email

Then click **Save permissions**.

Now, let’s do a `git status` again to confirm the permission changes we did was tracked locally in your git repository.

We can now commit this change:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "added permission for uses"
```

Now let’s create a serverless function before we push all changes to GitHub so Nhost can deploy our changes.

### Serverless Function

A serverless function is a pieces of code written in JavaScript or TypeScript that take an HTTP request and returns a response.

Here’s an example:

```bash
import { Request, Response } from 'express'

export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

Serverless functions are placed in the `functions/` folder of your repository. Every file will become its own endpoint.

Before we create our serverless function we’ll install `express`, which is a requirement for serverless functions to work.

```bash
npm install express
# or with yarn
yarn add express
```

We’ll use TypeScript so we’ll install two type definitions too:

```bash
npm install -d @types/node @types/express
# or with yarn
yarn add -D @types/node @types/express
```

Then we’ll create a file `functions/time.ts`

In the file `time.ts` we’ll add the following code to create our serverless function:

```bash
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  return res
    .status(200)
    .send(`Hello ${req.query.name}! It's now: ${new Date().toUTCString()}`);
};
```

We can now test the function locally. Locally, the backend URL is `http://localhost:1337`. Functions are under `/v1/functions`. And every function’s path and filename becomes an API endpoint.

This means our function `functions/time.ts` is at `http://localhost:1337/v1/functions/time`.

Let’s use curl to test our new function:

```bash
curl http://localhost:1337/v1/functions/time
Hello undefined! It's now: Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:44:45 GMT
```

And with a query parameter with our name:

```bash
curl http://localhost:1337/v1/functions/time\?name\=Johan
Hello Johan! It's now: Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:44:48 GMT
```

Again, let’s use `git status` to see the changes we did to create our serverless function.

Now let’s commit the changes and push them to GitHub.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "added serverless function"
git push
```

In the Nhost Console, click on the new deployment to see details.

After Nhost has finished deploying your changes we can test them in production. First let’s confirm that the user permissions are applied.

Then, let’s confirm that the serverless function was deployed. Again, we’ll use curl:

```bash
curl https://your-backend-url.nhost.run/v1/functions/time\?name\=Johan
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we have installed the Nhost CLI and created a local Nhost environment to do local development and testing.

In the local environment we’ve made changes to our database, to Hasura’s metadata and created a serverless function.

We’ve connected a GitHub repository and pushed our changes to GitHub.

We’ve seen Nhost automatically deploying our changes and we’ve verified that the changes were applied.

In summary, we’ve set up a productive environment using the recommended Nhost workflow:

1. Develop locally using the Nhost CLI.
2. Push changes to GitHub.
3. Nhost deploys changes to production.

What follows is a detailed tutorial on how you setup Nhost for this workflow

### Create Nhost App

Create a **new Nhost app** for this tutorial.

> Itâ€™s important that you create a **new** Nhost app for this guide instead of reusing an old Nhost app because we want to start with a clean Nhost app.

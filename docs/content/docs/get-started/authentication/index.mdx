title: 'Authenticate users'
---

You defined `select` permissions for the `public` role in the previous section. You will now add `insert` and `create` permissions for authenticated users to secure your app's GraphQL API with authentication.

> Nhost's authentication service lets you deliver frictionless registration and login experiences to your users. We support most social providers and different methods such as email & password and passwordless (magic link).

---

## Insert a test user

Manually create a user by going to your app's **Users** tab (top menu) and clicking on **Add User**.

You will now use that newly created user to make authenticated requests to the API.

## Authenticate and query data

Add the following code to sign in the new user and request the list of todos again:

```js
import { NhostClient } from '@nhost/nhost-js'

const nhost = new NhostClient({
  backendUrl: 'https://[app-subdomain].nhost.run'
})(async () => {
  // Sign in user
  const signInResponse = await nhost.auth.signIn({
    email: 'joe@example.com',
    password: 'securepassword'
  })

  // Handle sign-in error
  if (signInResponse.error) {
    throw signInResponse.error
  }

  // Get todos
  const todos = await nhost.graphql.request(`
    query {
      todos {
        id
        created_at
        name
        is_completed
      }
    }
  `)

  console.log(JSON.stringify(todos.data, null, 2))
})()
```

Why is the return value `null`? Because when making GraphQL requests as an authenticated user, the `user` role is assumed.

> For authenticated requests, there is always the option to override the default `user` role with any other valid role.

## Permissions for users

### Remove permissions for the public role

We won't use the `public` role anymore, so let's remove all permission for that role.

Now we'll add permissions for the `user` role.

> All logged-in users have the `user` role.

### Insert permission

First, we'll set the **Insert permission**.

A user can only insert `name` because all other columns will be set automatically. More specifically, `user_id` is set to the user's id making the request (`x-hasura-user-id`) and is configured in the `Column presets` section. See the image below.

### Select permission

For **Select permission**, set a **custom check** so users can only select todos where `user_id` is the same as their user id. In other words: users are only allowed to select their own todos. See the image below.

Now rerun the app. New todos are inserted, and only todos for the user are fetched and displayed. Your backend is successfully secured!

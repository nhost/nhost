## Updating the Nhost CLI

Update an existing installation to the latest version.

```bash Terminal
nhost sw upgrade
```

## Running Nhost

Inside of the folder where you want to create your project, run:

```bash Terminal
> nhost init

Initializing Nhost project
Successfully initialized Nhost project, run `nhost up` to start development
```

`init` will scaffold a bunch of files that Nhost uses to manage configuration, database schema and migrations, APIs, functions, etc.

With the project scaffolding in place, start the local Nhost instance with `nhost up`:

```bash Terminal
> nhost up

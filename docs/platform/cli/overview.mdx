## Choose Your Workflow

**New to Nhost?** Start with [Local Development](/platform/cli/local-development) to run everything on your machine and get familiar with the platform.

**Working with a team?** Try [Cloud Development](/platform/cli/cloud-development) to develop against shared cloud infrastructure while maintaining local development tools.

Both workflows support the same powerful features and can be used together as your project evolves.

# CLI Overview

The Nhost CLI provides a seamless local development experience, allowing you to run the entire Nhost stack on your local machine. This approach enables fast iteration times, offline development capabilities, and an environment that closely mirrors production.

## CLI Workflow

The Nhost CLI follows a simple workflow pattern:

1. **Set Up** - Install the CLI and dependencies
2. **Initialize** - Create a new project or link to existing one
3. **Develop** - Make changes locally with immediate feedback
4. **Deploy** - Push changes to production when ready

For detailed installation and setup instructions, see the [Local Development](/platform/cli/local-development) guide.

When you start the CLI the services are exposed similarly to the way they are exposed in the [cloud](/platform/subdomain). For instance, the following information is shown on your terminal after running `nhost up`

```
> nhost up
...
URLs:
- Postgres:             postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/local
- Hasura:               https://local.hasura.local.nhost.run
- GraphQL:              https://local.graphql.local.nhost.run
- Auth:                 https://local.auth.local.nhost.run
- Storage:              https://local.storage.local.nhost.run
- Functions:            https://local.functions.local.nhost.run
- Dashboard:            https://local.dashboard.local.nhost.run
- Mailhog:              https://local.mailhog.local.nhost.run

SDK Configuration:
 Subdomain:             local
 Region:                local
```

There you can see the various URLs you can use to access each service plus the region and subdomain you can use to configure the SDK:

```ts
// Create a new Nhost client for local development.
const nhost = new NhostClient(
    { region: 'local', subdomain: 'local' }
)
```

The domains in the URLs above will all return the IP address for localhost, `127.0.0.1`, which should suffice for most development environments. For instance:

```
> host local.auth.local.nhost.run
local.auth.local.nhost.run has address 127.0.0.1
```

However, those URLs are powered by a dynamic DNS that can return any IPv4 address you need, you just need to replace the subdomain `local` with a `subdomain` that contains the 4 octets of the IPv4 address you want separated by `-`. For instance:

```
> host 192-168-100-1.auth.local.nhost.run
192-168-100-1.auth.local.nhost.run has address 192.168.100.1

> host 10-10-1-108.auth.local.nhost.run
10-10-1-108.auth.local.nhost.run has address 10.10.1.108
```

This is useful if you need to connect to your environment from a different device, a VM or a mobile device emulator.

<Warning>
Some ISPs filter DNS responses that point to localhost and/or private IP space. If your provider is one of them you may have troubles accessing your local dev environment. As a workaround you have two options:

1. Follow the instructions under [offline access](/guides/cli/subdomain#offline-access) to create static DNS entries in your machine.
2. Configure your computer to use a different [DNS provider](https://privacysavvy.com/security/business/best-free-public-dns-servers/).
</Warning>

To make use of this functionality you can start your development environment after setting the environment variable `NHOST_LOCAL_SUBDOMAIN` or passing the flag `--local-subdomain` :

```
> export NHOST_LOCAL_SUBDOMAIN=192-168-1-1-8 # either this or --local-subdomain 192-168-1-108
> nhost --local-subdomain 192-168-1-108 up
...
Nhost development environment started.
URLs:
- Postgres:         postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/local
- Hasura:           https://192-168-1-108.hasura.local.nhost.run
- GraphQL:          https://192-168-1-108.graphql.local.nhost.run
- Auth:             https://192-168-1-108.auth.local.nhost.run
- Storage:          https://192-168-1-108.storage.local.nhost.run
- Functions:        https://192-168-1-108.functions.local.nhost.run
- Dashboard:        https://192-168-1-108.dashboard.local.nhost.run
- Mailhog:          https://192-168-1-108.mailhog.local.nhost.run

SDK Configuration:
 Subdomain:    192-168-1-108
 Region:       local
Run `nhost up` to reload the development environment
Run `nhost down` to stop the development environment
Run `nhost logs` to watch the logs
```

Now you can configure the SDK with:

```ts
// Create a new Nhost client for local development.
const nhost = new NhostClient(
    { region: 'local', subdomain: '192-168-1-108' }
)
```

<Warning>
If you are trying to connect to your local environment from an external device or VM make sure that:

- The IP address you are using is reachable from this device/VM
- That your firewall isn't blocking requests
</Warning>

<Warning>
If you are testing a social provider don't forget you will need to configure the callback URL to match the subdomain/region you are using. The dashboard should be able to provide this information in settings page.
</Warning>

## Offline access

All the URLs in this document are resolved by a public DNS, which means you need Internet access to resolve them. If you need to use any of those URLs without Internet access you can add them to your `/etc/hosts` file. For instance:

```
> cat /etc/hosts
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
# ::1             localhost

127.0.0.1 local.auth.local.nhost.run local.storage.local.nhost.run ...
```

Just start with the IP you want to resolve followed by all the entries you need separated by spaces.

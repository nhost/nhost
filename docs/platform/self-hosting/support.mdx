For organizations seeking additional reliability and expert assistance, we offer a professional support agreement for self-hosted deployments:

- Our team provides expert guidance on architecture, codebase, infrastructure optimization, and best practices
- Access to a dedicated Discord channel for direct communication with our support engineers
- Defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for response times and issue resolution
- Priority troubleshooting for critical issues

This option balances the flexibility of self-hosting with the security of professional support when you need it most.

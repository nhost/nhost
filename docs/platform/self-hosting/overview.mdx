Nhost is designed to be flexible in how you deploy and manage it. Here's an overview of the self-hosting options available for your infrastructure:

## Self-Hosting Options

### Community Edition

You can host Nhost on your own infrastructure completely independently with support from our community. This option gives you full control over your deployment while leveraging open-source documentation and community forums for assistance.

### Support Agreement

For organizations requiring more reliable support, you can self-host Nhost while benefiting from our professional support agreement. This provides you with direct access to our team for troubleshooting, optimization advice, and implementation guidance.

### Dedicated Cluster

For teams with specific requirements or higher security needs, we offer dedicated cluster deployments. This enterprise-grade option provides a fully-managed Nhost environment on your infrastructure, with our team handling setup, maintenance, and optimization.

Each option allows you to maintain your data within your own infrastructure while choosing the level of support that matches your team's needs and technical capabilities.

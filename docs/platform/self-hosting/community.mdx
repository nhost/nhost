If you enjoy server administration, infrastructure management, and operational responsibilities, you can host Nhost on your own infrastructure with support from our community. We provide an official reference implementation for demonstration purposes in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/tree/main/examples/docker-compose).

Need assistance? Our community is ready to help:
- Join discussions in our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/9V7Qb2U)
- Participate in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/discussions)

Our community edition gives you complete control over your deployment while benefiting from the collective knowledge of Nhost users worldwide.

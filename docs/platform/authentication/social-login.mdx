Nhost Auth supports the following social login providers:

- GitHub
- Google
- Facebook
- LinkedIn

---

## Enabling social login

To start with social login, select your app in Nhost Console and go to **Users** â†’ **Login settings**.

Enabling any of the supported login providers requires a developer account for the selected login provider. Follow the on-screen instructions to enable the login method of your choosing.

## Implementing login experience

To implement social login in your app, use the [Nhost JavaScript SDK](/reference/sdk) and the `signIn()` method:

```js
nhost.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'github'
})
```

## OAuth scopes

Scopes are a mechanism in OAuth to allow or limit an application's access to a user's account.

By default, Nhost sets the scope to get the name, email and avatar for each user. Editing scope is not currently supported.

Services in the Nhost Cloud adhere to the following format:

- https://&lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;service&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.nhost.run

When you set up a new project in Nhost Cloud, you're assigned a subdomain that, along with the region where the project was created, allows you to generate the different URLs for your services. For example:

![dashboard](/images/platform/subdomain.png)

With that information at hand generating the URLs for the various services is trivial:

- https://xglwkhjnufblhgtwtfwz.auth.us-west-2.nhost.run
- https://xglwkhjnufblhgtwtfwz.db.us-west-2.nhost.run
- https://xglwkhjnufblhgtwtfwz.functions.us-west-2.nhost.run
- https://xglwkhjnufblhgtwtfwz.graphql.us-west-2.nhost.run
- https://xglwkhjnufblhgtwtfwz.hasura.us-west-2.nhost.run
- https://xglwkhjnufblhgtwtfwz.storage.us-west-2.nhost.run

If you are using our SDK you can just specify the region and subdomain and the SDK will automatically generate these URLs for you. For instance:


```ts
// Create a new Nhost client for local development.
const nhost = new NhostClient(
    { region: 'xglwkhjnufblhgtwtfwz', subdomain: 'us-west-2' }
)
```

<Note>
If you want to use your own domain you can head to the [custom domains documentation](/platform/custom-domains)

For information on how to access your local environment check the [cli documentation](/guides/cli/subdomain)

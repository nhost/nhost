By connecting your Nhost project to GitHub, you can set up a seamless CI/CD workflow that takes care of deploying your database migrations, GraphQL metadata, and serverless functions.

## Getting Started

Connecting to GitHub only takes a few minutes. Here's how to do it:

1. Head over to your project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Git**
3. Click the **Connect to GitHub** button

## Authorizing Nhost

When you click the connect button, you'll be redirected to GitHub where you'll need to:

- Install the Nhost GitHub App on your account
- Choose which repositories Nhost can access (you can select specific repos or grant access to all of them)

Don't worry - Nhost only requests the permissions it needs to deploy your project.

## Configuring Your Repository

After authorizing the GitHub integration, you'll need to tell Nhost a couple of important details:

### Base Directory

This is the folder in your repository where your Nhost folder lives. If your Nhost foder is in the root of your repository, you can leave this as `/`. If it is in a subfolder (like `/backend`), specify that path here.

### Deployment Branch

Choose which branch should trigger deployments when pushed to. This is typically:
- `main` or `master` for production environments
- `develop` or `staging` for development environments

## How Deployments Work

Once everything is set up, here's what happens:

1. You push code to your deployment branch
2. We do the rest. We:
   1. Checkout your commit
   2. Deploy your `nhost.toml`
   3. Deploy any new database migrations
   4. Apply GraphQL metadata
   5. Deploy new or modified serverless functions

You can head to your project's deployment tab to see your deployments and their logs.

## Automatic Deploys

Nhost deploys your project everytime new code is pushed to the branch connected to it. 

## Pipeline

During a deployment, the following happens:


<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull Repository">
    Nhost pulls down your connected repository, and deletes it after the deployment completes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Configuration">
    Nhost makes sure the state of your cloud instance reflects the one described in `./nhost/nhost.toml`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Database Migrations">
    New migrations present in `./nhost/migrations` are applied to your PostgreSQL instance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Metadata Changes">
    Metadata changes from  `./nhost/metadata` are applied to the Hasura Instance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy Functions">
    Functions inside `./functions` are deployed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

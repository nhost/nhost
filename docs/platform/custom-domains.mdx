Custom domains empower you to offer a tailored and branded experience for your users. Available only as an add-on for projects on the pro and enterprise plans, custom domains not only enhance your brand's visibility but also provide a more professional appearance compared to using Nhost's default domain.

You can configure Custom Domains for Auth, Hasura, PostgreSQL, and your own Run services using both the Nhost Dashboard or the Config file.

The following examples assume we are configuring custom domains at `*.custom-domain.com`.

  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    Follow the instructions in the Custom Domain section of your project's settings:

    1. Add a CNAME record in your DNS provider for each of the services you want a custom domain for, and click "Verify". The verification might take a few seconds to succeed.
    2. Once the verification succeeds, click "Save" to update your project.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Config File">
    The first step is to add a CNAME record in your DNS provider for each of the services you want a custom domain for. You can find the instructions in the dashboard tab.

    For Hasura, Auth, and Functions, custom domains are defined in the default `./nhost/config.toml` as follows:

```toml
[[hasura.resources.networking.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['hasura.custom-domain.com']

[[auth.resources.networking.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['auth.custom-domain.com']

[[functions.resources.networking.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['functions.custom-domain.com']
```

For PostgreSQL there is nothing to configure on Nhost's side so as long as you have a CNAME properly configured it should work.

<Note>To connect to your backend using your custom domains instead of the subdomain and region you will have to pass the verious service URLs to the client. You can find the relevant parameters to pass to the client in the reference documentation (i.e. [react](/reference/react/nhost-client#nhostclient))</Note>

For Run services, typically in an `nhost-service.toml` specific to the service:

```toml
name = 'my-service'

[image]
image = 'docker.io/nhost/my-service'

[[ports]]
port = 8080
type= 'http'
publish = true

[[ports.ingresses]]
fqdn = ['my-service.custom-domain.com']
```

  </Tab>

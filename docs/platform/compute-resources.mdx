Compute resources are the fundamental units that represent the processing power and memory available to your projects. The primary compute resources are vCPU and RAM.

This documentation outlines the key aspects of compute resources in the context of the Nhost Cloud Platform.

<Tip>To further improve availability and fault tolerance, check out [Service Replicas](/platform/service-replicas)</Tip>

## Shared Compute

In a shared model, compute resources are shared amongst users. This is fine if your services mostly run at low to medium load, occasionally burst for brief periods of time, and can tolerate drops in performance. It is important to understand that the availability of CPU time is **not guaranteed**.

### Free Plan

Projects on the free tier have a total of 2 shared vCPUs and 1 GiB of RAM spread over services as follows:

| Service | CPU (MiB) | Memory (GiB) |
| --------| ----------|--------------|
| Postgres| 0.5 | 256 |
| Hasura  | 0.5 | 384 |
| Auth    | 0.5 | 256 |
| Storage | 0.5 | 128 |

### Pro Plan

Projects on the pro tier have a total of 2 shared vCPUs and 2 GiB of RAM spread over services as follows:

| Service | CPU (MiB) | Memory (GiB) |
| --------| ----------|--------------|
| Postgres| 0.5 | 512 |
| Hasura  | 0.5 | 768 |
| Auth    | 0.5 | 384 |
| Storage | 0.5 | 384 |



## Dedicated Compute

For production workloads where latency is essential or consistent performance is non-negotiable, we strongly suggest the use of dedicated resources.

<Note>Compute/Dedicated resources are only available on the Pro plan</Note>


To setup dedicated resources for your project, you can either use the Dashboard or the Config.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Config">
    ```bash nhost/nhost.toml
    [hasura.resources.compute]
    cpu = 500
    memory = 1024

    [auth.resources.compute]
    cpu = 500
    memory = 1024

    [postgres.resources.compute]
    cpu = 500
    memory = 1024

    [storage.resources.compute]
    cpu = 500
    memory = 1024
  ```
  </Tab>

## Disk Performance

By default disks are provisioned but a capacity for 3000 IOPS and 125 Mbps of throughput. If you need higher performance don't hesitate to contact us.

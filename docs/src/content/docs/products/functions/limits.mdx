## JavaScript and TypeScript Only

Each function is bundled and minified into a single JavaScript file during deployment. Native binaries and non-JavaScript code are stripped out in this process, so libraries that rely on native addons will not work. Common examples include:

- **sharp** (image processing) — uses native C++ bindings
- **bcrypt** — uses native C bindings (use `bcryptjs` instead)
- **better-sqlite3** — embeds a native SQLite binary
- **canvas** — depends on native Cairo bindings

If you need native dependencies or a non-JavaScript runtime, use [Nhost Run](/products/run/) instead.

## Execution Timeout

Function execution timeout limits vary by project tier:

| Tier           | Timeout              |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| **Starter**    | 10 seconds           |
| **Pro**        | 180 seconds (3 min)  |
| **Teams**      | 600 seconds (10 min) |
| **Enterprise** | Custom               |

If a function exceeds its timeout, the execution is terminated and the client receives an error response.

## Response Payload

All functions have a hard limit of **6 MB** for response payloads, regardless of the project tier.

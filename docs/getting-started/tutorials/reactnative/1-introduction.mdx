Welcome to the **Full-Stack React Native Development with Nhost** series! In this comprehensive tutorial series, you'll build a complete React Native application with Nhost that demonstrates authentication, database operations, and file management.

## About This Tutorial Series

This tutorial series is divided into **5 parts**, each focusing on a specific aspect of building modern mobile applications with Nhost and React Native. By the end of the series, you'll have built a fully functional application featuring:

- **User Authentication** - Complete sign up, sign in, and email verification flow
- **Todo Management** - Users can create, update, delete, and mark todos as complete
- **File Uploads** - Users can upload and manage files with proper permissions
- **Protected Routes** - Secure screens that only authenticated users can access

<Info>
This is **Part 1** in the Full-Stack React Native Development with Nhost series. This part sets up the foundation by creating your Nhost project and understanding the series structure.

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this series, you'll master:

- Setting up and configuring Nhost projects
- Implementing secure authentication flows with React Native
- Building protected screens with Expo Router
- Performing GraphQL queries and mutations
- Managing file uploads and storage
- Configuring database permissions and security
- Building responsive React Native interfaces

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of React Native and JavaScript
- Understanding of modern mobile development concepts
- Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)

Creating an Nhost project is the first step to building your application with Nhost. Let's get started by setting up your backend infrastructure.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
<Step>

### Sign Up or Log in

If you don't have an Nhost account, sign up at [Nhost](https://app.nhost.io/). If you already have an account, log in.

</Step>

<Step>

### Create a New Project

Click on the "Create Project" button on your dashboard or follow the onboarding prompts if you're a new user.

</Step>

<Step>

### Take note of your project subdomain and region

Take note of your project subdomain and region. You will need this information to connect your application to the Nhost backend in upcoming tutorials.

</Step>

</Steps>

## What's Next?

With your Nhost project created, you now have access to:

- [**PostgreSQL Database**](/products/database/overview) - For storing your application data
- [**Authentication Service**](/products/auth/overview) - For managing users and sessions
- [**GraphQL API**](/products/graphql/overview) - For querying and mutating data
- [**File Storage**](/products/storage/overview) - For uploading and managing files
- [**Functions**](/products/functions/overview) - For running serverless functions

In the [next tutorial](/getting-started/tutorials/reactnative/2-protected-routes), you'll start building your React Native application and learn how to protect screens based on user authentication status.

<Tip>
Keep your project subdomain and region handy - you'll need them throughout the series to connect your React Native application to the Nhost backend.

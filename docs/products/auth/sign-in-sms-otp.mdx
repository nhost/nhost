An SMS OTP (one-time password) is a secure authorization method where a numeric or alphanumeric code is sent to a mobile phone number.

Nhost supports OTP via SMS with Twilio.

## Configuration

You need a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) to use this feature because all SMS' are sent through Twilio.

Enable the Phone Number (SMS) sign-in method in the Nhost Dashboard under **Settings -> Sign-In Methods -> Phone Number (SMS)**.

You need to configure the following:

- Account SID
- Auth Token
- Messaging Service SID (or a Twilio phone number)

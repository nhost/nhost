## Allowed Emails and Domains

Allowed Emails and Domains are used to restrict what email adresses and domains are valid when signing up and signing in.

If both allowed emails and allowed domains are set a user can only sign up if their email address matches one of the allowed emails or one of the allowed domains.

## Blocked Emails and Domains

Blocked Emails and Domains are used to block specific email addresses and domains from signing up and signing in.

Note that even if a user's email address matches any allowed email or domain, they will still be blocked if their email address matches any blocked email or domain.

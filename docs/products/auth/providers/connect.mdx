With the provider connect feature, users can link configured providers with their account, regardless of the initial sign-up method. It enables users to link different providers to their accounts, even if the email addresses do not match (e.g., linking a GitHub profile to an account registered with a different email). This feature offers flexibility, allowing users to streamline their login process by connecting multiple authentication methods.

To add a provider authentication method to an existing user you need to call the url `https://${subdomain}.auth.${region}.nhost.run/v1/signin/provider/${provider}?connect=${jwt}`. This is very easy to achieve with our SDK:

``` js
nhost.auth.connectProvider({
  provider: 'github'
})
```

<Note>
Keep in mind that as we need a `JWT` the user needs to be logged in.

## Viewing and Deleting Provider Authentication Mechanisms

If you want to allow your users to view and/or delete provider authentication mechanisms, you can provide the necessary permissions to the table `auth.user_providers` (i.e. `select` and/or `delete`) and then use the appropriate GraphQL query. For example, the following permissions should allow users to list their own providers:

![provider connect permissions](/images/auth/provider-connect-permissions.png)

Using the following GraphQL query:

``` js
const { error, data } = await nhost.graphql.request(
  gql`
    query getAuthUserProviders {
      authUserProviders {
        id
        providerId
      }
    }
  `,
)
```

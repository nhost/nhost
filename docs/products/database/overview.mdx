All Nhost projects have their own dedicated PostgreSQL instance, an advanced, open-source object-relational database system known for its robustness, durability, and performance.

With a history of over 30 years of active development, PostgreSQL offers a versatile solution for managing data in a wide range of applications.

## Dashboard

Manage your database with the Nhost Dashboard. Create tables, relationships, manage data, or run arbitrary SQL, with a simple but powerful UI.

### Extensions

Extensions are one of Postgres' best features because they allow us to extend the functionality of our databases.

Nhost supports a bunch of extensions that you can install for functionalities such as full-text search capabilities with pgvector or geographic object support with PostGIS.

You can find the complete list of supported extensions [here](/products/database/extensions).

### Additional Features

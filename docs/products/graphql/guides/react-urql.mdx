You can use Nhost with [urql](https://nearform.com/open-source/urql/docs/) in your React applications. Urql is a highly customizable and versatile GraphQL client that makes it easy to fetch, cache, and manage GraphQL data in your React applications.

You can find a working example with instructions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/blob/main/examples/guides/react-urql/README.md).

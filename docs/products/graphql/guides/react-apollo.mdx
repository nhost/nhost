You can use Nhost with [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) in your React applications. Apollo Client is a popular GraphQL client that helps you manage data and state in your React apps.

You can find a working example with instructions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/blob/main/examples/guides/react-apollo/README.md).

You can use Nhost with [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) in your React applications. React Query is a popular data-fetching library that helps you manage server state in your React apps.

You can find a working example with instructions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/blob/main/examples/guides/react-query/README.md).

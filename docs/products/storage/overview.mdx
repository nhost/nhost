Nhost Storage lets your users upload and download files. Nhost Storage is partially integrated with the GraphQL API, where file metadata and permissions are managed. Files are stored in S3 and served via a CDN.

## Files

Files can be of any type, such as images, documents, videos, etc.

File metadata is stored in your database in the `files` table in the `storage` schema. This means that file metadata is available in your GraphQL API, which makes it easy to:

- Read file metadata via GraphQL.
- Manage file permissions (in Hasura).
- Create GraphQL relationships between files and your database tables.

<Warning>
  Don't modify the database schema, nor GraphQL root fields in any of the tables in the `storage`
  schema.
</Warning>

<Tip>
You're allowed to add and modify the following:

- GraphQL Relationships
- Permissions
</Tip>

### Upload File

When a file is uploaded, the file metadata is inserted into the `storage.files` table and a file `id` is returned. The file's `id` is how you reference and access the file.

You can upload files to a specific bucket and include custom metadata:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">

```js
// Basic file upload
const uploadResp = await nhost.storage.uploadFiles({
  'file[]': [new File(['test content'], 'test-file.txt', { type: 'text/plain' })]
})

// Upload to specific bucket with metadata
const uploadWithMetadata = await nhost.storage.uploadFiles({
  'bucket-id': 'user-uploads',
  'file[]': [new File(['test content'], 'test-file.txt', { type: 'text/plain' })],
  'metadata[]': [{
    name: 'custom-filename.txt',
    metadata: {
      alt: 'Custom description',
      category: 'document'
    }
  }]
})
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HTTP">

```http
POST https://local.storage.local.nhost.run/v1/files HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>

--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file[]"; filename="test-file.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

test content
--boundary--
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Download File

There are two ways to download a file:

- Public URL
- Pre-signed URL

#### Public URL

Public URLs are available for both unauthenticated and authenticated users. Permissions are checked for every file request. Files are served via CDN for optimal performance.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">

```js
// Download file content
const downloadResp = await nhost.storage.getFile(fileId)
const fileBlob = downloadResp.body
const fileContent = await fileBlob.text()

// Get file metadata headers only (without downloading content)
const metadataResp = await nhost.storage.getFileMetadataHeaders(fileId)
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HTTP">

```http
GET https://local.storage.local.nhost.run/v1/files/{file_id} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>

# Get metadata headers only
HEAD https://local.storage.local.nhost.run/v1/files/{file_id} HTTP/1.1
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Public URLs support:
- **Conditional requests** using `If-Modified-Since`, `If-None-Match` headers for caching
- **Range requests** for partial file downloads using the `Range` header
- **Image transformations** via query parameters (see Image Transformation section)

#### Pre-signed URL

Pre-signed URLs work differently from public URLs and are ideal for temporary, secure access.

**How they work:**
- Permission check happens only when requesting the pre-signed URL
- Once generated, anyone with the URL can download the file (no additional auth required)
- URLs expire after a configurable time period

**Expiration settings:**
- Default bucket: 30 seconds expiration
- Configurable per bucket via the `download_expiration` field (in seconds)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">

```js
// Get pre-signed URL
const resp = await nhost.storage.getFilePresignedURL(fileId)
console.log('URL:', resp.body.url)
console.log('Expires in:', resp.body.expiration, 'seconds')

// Use the URL directly (no auth headers needed)
const fileResponse = await fetch(resp.body.url)
const fileBlob = await fileResponse.blob()
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HTTP">

```http
GET https://local.storage.local.nhost.run/v1/files/{file_id}/presignedurl HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>

# Response:
{
  "url": "https://storage.example.com/files/abc123?X-Amz-Algorithm=...",
  "expiration": 1800
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Delete File

Delete a file and the file metadata in the database. This permanently removes both the file content from storage and its associated metadata.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">

```js
await nhost.storage.deleteFile(fileId)
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HTTP">

```http
DELETE https://local.storage.local.nhost.run/v1/files/{file_id} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
File deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Always delete files via the Nhost Storage API to ensure both the file content and metadata are properly removed.
</Warning>

### Replace File

Replace an existing file with new content while preserving the file ID. This is useful when you need to update a file without changing references to it.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">

```js
const newFile = new File(['updated content'], 'updated-file.txt', { type: 'text/plain' })

const replaceResp = await nhost.storage.replaceFile(fileId, {
  file: newFile,
  metadata: {
    name: 'new-filename.txt',
    metadata: {
      version: '2.0',
      updated: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  }
})
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HTTP">

```http
PUT https://local.storage.local.nhost.run/v1/files/{file_id} HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>

--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="updated-file.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

updated content
--boundary--
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The replace operation follows these steps:
1. Sets `isUploaded` flag to `false` during the update process
2. Replaces the file content in storage
3. Updates file metadata (size, mime-type, etc.)
4. Sets `isUploaded` flag back to `true`

## Buckets

Buckets are containers used to organize files and group permissions. They provide a way to apply different configurations and access controls to different types of files. Buckets are stored in the `storage.buckets` table in your database and are accessible via the `buckets` field in your GraphQL API.

### Bucket Configuration

Each bucket can be configured with the following properties:

#### File Restrictions
- **Minimum size** - Minimum file size in bytes
- **Maximum size** - Maximum file size in bytes to prevent large uploads

#### Access Control
- **Cache control** - HTTP cache headers for files in this bucket
- **Allow pre-signed URLs** - Whether files can be accessed via pre-signed URLs
- **Download expiration** - Expiration time in seconds for pre-signed URLs

### Default Bucket

- Every Nhost project includes a `default` bucket
- Used automatically when no bucket is specified during upload
- Cannot be deleted (system requirement)
- Has standard configuration suitable for most use cases

### Working with Buckets

#### Upload to Specific Bucket

```js
// Upload to a custom bucket
const uploadResp = await nhost.storage.uploadFiles({
  'bucket-id': 'user-profiles',
  'file[]': [profileImage]
})
```

#### GraphQL Bucket Management

You can query and manage buckets through your GraphQL API:

```graphql
query GetBuckets {
  buckets {
    id
    minUploadFileSize
    maxUploadFileSize
    presignedUrlsEnabled
    downloadExpiration
    cacheControl
  }
}
```

### Common Bucket Patterns

**User Uploads**: Separate public and private user content
```
- user-public (images, documents accessible to others)
- user-private (personal files, drafts)
```

**Content Types**: Organize by file type or purpose
```
- images (profile pictures, thumbnails)
- documents (PDFs, spreadsheets)
- media (videos, audio files)
```

**Environment-based**: Different buckets for different environments
```
- dev-uploads
- staging-uploads
- prod-uploads
```

## Permissions

Permissions to upload, download, and delete files are managed through Hasura's permission system on the `storage.files` table.

### Upload

To upload a file, a user must have the **`insert` permission** to the `storage.files` table. The `id` column must be granted.

The following columns can be used for insert permissions:

- `id`
- `bucket_id`
- `name`
- `size`
- `mime_type`

### Download

To download a file, a user must have the **`select` permission** to the `storage.files` table. **All** columns must be granted.

### Delete

To delete a file, a user must have the **`delete` permission** to the `storage.files` table.

<Warning>
Just deleting the file metadata in the `storage.files` table does **not** delete the actual file. Always delete files via Nhost Storage. This way, both the file metadata and the actual file are deleted.
</Warning>

## Image Transformation

Images can be transformed on-the-fly by adding query parameters to file URLs. This feature works with both public URLs and pre-signed URLs, allowing you to resize, optimize, and convert images without pre-processing.

### Available Transformations

#### Resize Parameters
- `w` - Maximum width to resize image to while maintaining aspect ratio
- `h` - Maximum height to resize image to while maintaining aspect ratio

#### Quality and Format
- `q` - Image quality (1-100). Applies to JPEG, WebP, and PNG files
- `f` - Output format. Options: `auto`, `same`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `png`, `avif`
  - `auto` - Uses content negotiation based on Accept header
  - `same` - Keeps original format (default)

#### Effects
- `b` - Blur the image using sigma value (0 or higher)

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">

```js
const transformedFile = await nhost.storage.getFile(fileId, {
  w: 400,
  h: 300,
  q: 90,
  f: 'webp'
})
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HTTP">

```http
# Resize to 500px width
GET https://[subdomain].storage.[region].nhost.run/v1/files/{file_id}?w=500

# Multiple transformations
GET https://[subdomain].storage.[region].nhost.run/v1/files/{file_id}?w=800&h=600&q=85&f=webp

# Auto format based on Accept header
GET https://[subdomain].storage.[region].nhost.run/v1/files/{file_id}?w=400&f=auto
Accept: image/webp,image/avif,image/*
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Use Cases

**Responsive Images**: Generate different sizes for various screen resolutions
```js
const thumbnailUrl = `${baseUrl}?w=150&h=150&q=80`
const mobileUrl = `${baseUrl}?w=400&q=85&f=webp`
const desktopUrl = `${baseUrl}?w=1200&q=90&f=webp`
```

**Performance Optimization**: Reduce file sizes and improve loading times
```js
const optimizedUrl = `${baseUrl}?q=75&f=webp`
```

**Image Effects**: Add visual effects like blur for backgrounds
```js
const blurredBg = `${baseUrl}?w=1920&h=1080&b=10&q=60`
```

<Tip>
Image transformations are cached at the CDN level for optimal performance. The first request might be slower as the transformed image is generated and cached.

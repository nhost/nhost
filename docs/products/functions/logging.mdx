Nhost Functions support logging through standard `console` methods in Node.js. Use `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, and `console.error()` to log messages during function execution. All logs are captured and displayed in the [logs page](https://app.nhost.io/orgs/_/projects/_/logs) page with metadata about each invocation.

## Log Format

Each log entry includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `log` | The actual log message |
| `path` | The function path that generated the log |
| `invocationId` | Unique identifier for this function invocation |
| `level` | Log level: `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR` |

Example log entry:

```json
{
  "log": "This was logged with console.log",
  "path": "/function",
  "invocationId": "cb1835df-a5e6-440b-ab59-e2e2f563c176",
  "level": "INFO"
}
```

## Execution Metrics

Each function execution also generates a metrics log entry with performance data:

```json
{
  "path": "/function",
  "invocationId": "cb1835df-a5e6-440b-ab59-e2e2f563c176",
  "status": "success",
  "metrics": {
    "durationMs": 11.067,
    "producedBytes": 718
  },
  "spans": [
    { "name": "responseLatency", "durationMs": 9.913, "start": "2026-01-10T11:38:03.850Z" },
    { "name": "responseDuration", "durationMs": 0.057, "start": "2026-01-10T11:38:03.860Z" },
    { "name": "runtimeOverhead", "durationMs": 1.023, "start": "2026-01-10T11:38:03.860Z" }
  ]
}
```

## Correlating Logs

### Invocation ID

The `invocationId` is unique to each function invocation and helps correlate all logs from the same execution. Access it in your code via:

```js
req.invocationId
```

### Request ID

You can pass a custom `x-request-id` header from the client for tracing requests across services:

```js
req.headers['x-request-id']
```

If not provided, a unique request ID is generated automatically.

<Note>
The `invocationId` and request ID serve different purposes:
- **invocationId**: Internal identifier for the function execution
- **x-request-id**: External identifier for tracing requests across services (can be set by the client)
</Note>

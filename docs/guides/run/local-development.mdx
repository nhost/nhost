You can start Nhost Run services alongside your Nhost project very easily using the [Nhost CLI](/guides/cli/local-development) by simply using the option `--run-service path/to/run-service.toml[:overlay_name]`, for instance:

![cli](/images/guides/run/local_development_1.png)

Let's first take a look at the commend above, the first thing you can notice is that multiple `--run-service` flags are supported. You can pass as many as you need and they all will be added to your project. You can also add or remove Run services to an already running instance by re-running the command specifying the final list of `--run-service` you want. Any missing service will be removed and any new one will be added.

The second thing you will notice is that one of the `--run-service` flags contains the suffix `:mysvc` while the other one doesn't. If you add to the configuration path the suffix `:overlay_name` the [configuration overlay](configuration-overlays) with name `overlay_name` will be applied.

The last thing to notice in the screenshot is that the URLs include information on how to connect to the Run service (in the example used in this guide only one of the started services expose a port):

```
- run-bun-gen:        From laptop:      http://localhost:5000
                      From services:    http://run-bun-gen:5000
```

Based on the information above, if you want to connect directly to your service from your laptop you can use the URL `http://localhost:5000` while if you want to connect to the Run service from another service (i.e. another Run service or hasura) you can use `http://run-bun-gen:5000`

<Note>You can also use the environment variable `NHOST_RUN_SERVICE` passing comma-separated values. For instance, the equivalent environment variable for this example would be `NHOST_RUN_SERVICE=../mysvc/nhost-run-service.toml:mysvc,../mysvc/nhost-run-service.toml`</Note>

<Warning>The Nhost CLI doesn't build services so make sure you build any image that might be needed for running `nhost run --run-service...`</Warning>

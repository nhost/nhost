Before reading this document about how to use configuration overlays with Run services make sure you are familiar with the concept of [configuration overlays](/guides/cli/configuration-overlays) and how they work.

Working with configuration overlays with Run services is very similar to working with them in the Nhost stack. There are a few differences though:

1. Commands to work with the configuration are located under `nhost run config-...`, for instance:

```
nhost run config-show --config ../mysvc/nhost-run-service.toml
name = 'bun-gen'

[image]
image = 'nhost/bun-generator:0.0.3'

[[environment]]
name = 'PEXELS_API_KEY'
value = 'asdasdasd'

[[ports]]
port = 5000
type = 'http'
publish = true

[resources]
replicas = 1

[resources.compute]
cpu = 62
memory = 128
```

2. Unless explicitly indicated by the help of the command, overlays are never applied automatically, a flag needs to be used to apply the overlay:

```
nhost run config-show --config ../mysvc/nhost-run-service.toml --overlay-name mysvc
name = 'mysvc'

[image]
image = 'nhost/bun-generator:0.0.3'

[[environment]]
name = 'PEXELS_API_KEY'
value = 'asdasdasd'

[[environment]]
name = 'ENVIRONMENT'
value = 'development'

[resources]
replicas = 1

[resources.compute]
cpu = 62
memory = 128
```

3. A notable exception of the point above is `nhost run config-deploy --service-id SERVICE_ID`, which, as indicated by the help, will apply automatically the overlay with name `SERVICE_ID` if it exists:

```
$ nhost run config-deploy --help
NAME:
   nhost run config-deploy - Deploy service configuration

USAGE:
   nhost run config-deploy [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --config value      Service configuration file (default: "nhost-run-service.toml") [$NHOST_RUN_SERVICE_CONFIG]
   --service-id value  Service ID to update. Applies overlay of the same name [$NHOST_RUN_SERVICE_ID]
   --help, -h          show help
```

4. Overlays will be located under the same base path as the specified configuration file, under `nhost/overlays` and prefixed with `run-`. If you are using the command `nhost run config-show --config ../mysvc/nhost-run-service.toml --overlay-name mysvc` to edit overlays this is handled by you and you don't need to be worried about. For instance:

```
$ nhost run config-show --config ../mysvc/nhost-run-service.toml --overlay-name mysvc
(output omitted for brevity)
$ find ../mysvc
find ../mysvc
../mysvc
../mysvc/nhost
../mysvc/nhost/overlays
../mysvc/nhost/overlays/run-mysvc.json
../mysvc/nhost/overlays/run-70dca23e-aeed-4351-b37d-9a4a6f17147f.json
../mysvc/nhost-run-service.toml
```

5. When running `nhost up --run-service ...` no overlay will be applied automatically. If you want to apply an overlay you will need to specify the name of the overlay name to apply by prefixing the path with `:overlay_name`, for instance: `nhost up --run-service ../mysvc/nhost-run-service.toml:mysvc`

## Compute

You can configure compute resources for your service like this:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dashboard">

![compute slider](/images/guides/run/resources_1.png)

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="toml">
```toml
[resources.compute]
cpu = 62
memory = 128
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you are configuring the resources via the configuration file instead of using the dashboard, keep in mind that cpu and memory allocation need to follow the following rules:

* The value of the `memory` parameter must be exactly 2,048 times the value of the cpu parameter.
* The value of the memory parameter must be within the range of 128 to 7,168 (inclusive).

Don't forget you can use `nhost run config-validate` command to verify your values are correct.

## Storage

By default a container's disk is ephemeral so data isn't persisted across reboots. If your service needs persistent storage you can attach one or more SSD disks by adding the following configuration:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dashboard">


![storage](/images/guides/run/resources_2.png)

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="toml">

```toml
[[resources.storage]]
name="database"
path="/var/lib/db"
capacity=10


[[resources.storage]]
name="data"
path="/mnt/data"
capacity=1
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


With the above configuration, two disks will be provided. The first disk named `database` will have a capacity of 10 GiB and will be mounted at `/var/lib/db`. The second disk named `data` will have a capacity of 1 GiB and will be mounted at ``/mnt/data`.`

<Warning>Please note that renaming a disk will result in the destruction of the old disk and the creation of a new one, potentially leading to data loss.</Warning>

<Warning>Volume capacity can not be decreased. Once a volume with a given size has been created, its capacity can only by expanded.</Warning>

It's important to note that disks are unique to each service and cannot be shared across multiple services.

## Pausing a service

To pause a service, simply set its number of replicas to `0`:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dashboard">


![pausing a service](/images/guides/run/resources_3.png)

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="toml">

```toml
[resources]
replicas = 0
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

When you pause a service, it will cease running while keeping any associated disk and registry intact.

<Info>While the service is paused, computing costs will not be charged. However, storage costs will continue to apply.</Info>

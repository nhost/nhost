Nhost Run services and the main Nhost stack share the same network, facilitating direct and efficient communication. This network connectivity offers low latency, high throughput, and eliminates egress costs.
## Connecting to the Nhost stack

To connect your service to the Nhost stack, use the following information:

- postgres: `postgres://postgres:<password>@postgres-service:5432/<subdomain>?sslmode=disable`
- hasura: base URL is `http://hasura-service:8080`
- hasura-auth: base URL is `http://hasura-auth-service:4000`
- hasura-storage: base URL is `http://hasura-storage-service:5000`

## Connecting to your service internally

To connect to your own service internally from another service, follow these steps:

1. Configure the desired port(s).

Example for Redis service:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dashboard">
![exposing a port](/images/guides/run/configure-port.png)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="toml">
```
[[ports]]
type = "tcp"
port = 6379
publish = false
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>


2. Once the port is configured, you can connect to the service using as host `run-${name}` and the corresponding port.

   Example: `redis://user:password@run-redis:6379`

If needed, you can open internally more than one port by repeating the block for each one of them:

Example for a service exposing the ports tcp/3000 and udp/4000:


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dashboard">
![exposing multiple ports](/images/guides/run/configure-multiple-ports.png)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="toml">
```
[[ports]]
type = "tcp"
port = 3000
publish = false

[[ports]]
type = "udp"
port = 4000
publish = false
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Exposing Your Service to the Internet

To expose your service to the internet, follow these steps:

1. Update your configuration with the relevant port information:

Example for a nodejs service exposing an API on port 3000:


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dashboard">
![expose http port](/images/guides/run/configure-http-port.png)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="toml">

```
[[ports]]
type = "http"
port = 3000
publish = true
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>Currently, only services of type `http` and `grpc` can be exposed to the internet.</Info>

2. Once the service of type `http` is published, you can connect to it using a URL with the following format:

  `https://<run_service_subdomain>-<port>.svc.<region>.nhost.run`

  For example:

  `https://zlbmqjfczuwqvsquujno-3000.svc.eu-central-1.nhost.run`


## GRPC

GRPC services are supported, however, they are only supported via [custom domains](/platform/custom-domains). To expose a GRPC service to the internet you can use the following configuration:

``` toml
...

[[ports]]
type = "grpc"
port = 5000
publish = false

[[ports.ingresses]]
fqdn = ["grpc.domain.com"]

...
```

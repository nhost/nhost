## Overview

To safeguard your Auth API against automated attacks from scripts and bots, you can implement [Cloudflare's Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/turnstile/). Turnstile offers CAPTCHA-like protection without user friction, as it doesn't require solving puzzles.

## Integration Benefits

1. **Selective Protection**: Auth integrates Turnstile specifically for all signup methods.
2. **API Accessibility**: Other API endpoints remain accessible for legitimate programmatic use.
3. **Bot Deterrence**: Manual verification during signup discourages unwanted bot activity.

This approach balances security with usability, ensuring robust protection where it matters most.

## Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a widget on Cloudflare">
  Sign up on [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com) if you haven't already.

  Go to your account -> Turnstile -> Add Widget. Then:
  - Set a descriptive name
  - In the domain, enter your frontend's domain
  - Set widget mode as "managed"

  Then click on "create" and write down the site key and the secret key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Turnstile integration on auth">
    Start by adding the following configuration to your Nhost project:
    <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Config">
    ```toml
    [auth.signUp.turnstile]
    secretKey = 'turnstileSecretKey'
    ```
    </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Replace `turnstileSecretKey` with the secret key from the first step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate turnstile into your sign up form">
    To integrate turnstile into your sign up form you can refer to [Cloudfare's documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/tutorials/login-pages). Just keep in mind a few things:

    - You don't need to do any verification of the response, just pass it to the Auth service on the `/signup/...` request in the header `x-cf-turnstile-response`.
    - The "server side verification" is done by the auth service and will return a forbidden status error if the header is not present or if the check didn't pass.
    - You will need to use the site key from step 1 to configure turnstile in your form
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pass turnstile's response to the signup request">
  To pass the response as a header change your request to include the header. For instance:

  ```js
  await signUpEmailPassword(
     email,
     password,
     {
       displayName,
     },
     {
       headers: {
         'x-cf-turnstile-response': turnstileResponse,
       },
     },
   );
  ```

  In the following [PR](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/pull/2897/files) you can see the changes that were needed in our very own dashboard to integrate turnstile.

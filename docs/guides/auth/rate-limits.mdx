Rate limits in an HTTP API are essential for protecting services against abuse and brute force attacks by restricting the number of requests a client can make within a specified time period. By enforcing rate limits, we can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, denial of service attacks, and excessive consumption of resources.

Limits work by setting a maximum number of requests (burst amount) allowed for a key within a specified time frame (recovery time). For example, with a limit of 30 requests and a recovery time of 5 minutes, a user can make up to 30 requests before hitting the limit. Additionally, the user receives an extra request every 10 seconds (5 * 60 / 30) until reaching the limit.

| Endpoints             | Key | Limits | Description | Minimum version |
| ----------------------|-----|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Any that sends emails<sup>1</sup> | Global | 10 / hour | Not configurable. This limit applies to any project without custom SMTP settings  | 0.33.0 |
| Any that sends emails<sup>1</sup> | Client IP | 10 / hour | Configurable. This limit applies to any project with custom SMTP settings and is configurable  | 0.33.0 |
| Any that sends SMS<sup>2</sup> | Client IP | 10 / hour | Configurable. | 0.33.0 |
| Any endpoint that an attacker may try to brute-force. This includes sign-in and verify endpoints<sup>3</sup> | Client IP | 10 / 5 minutes | Configurable | 0.33.0 |
| Signup endpoints | Client IP | 10 / 5 minutes | Configurable | 0.33.0 |
| Any | Client IP | 100 / minute | The total sum of requests to any endpoint (including previous ones) can not exceed this limit | 0.33.0 |

<Note>
Limits are grouped within a given category. For instance, with a limit of 10 per hour for the sign-in/verify category, if a user attempts to sign in 10 times and then tries to verify an OTP code, the latter will be rate-limited alongside the sign-in attempts.

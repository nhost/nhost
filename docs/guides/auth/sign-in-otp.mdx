One-Time Passwords (OTPs) are temporary codes for single use that can be delivered to users via email. OTPs expire after 5 minutes and can only be used once. OTPs can provide a more secure and convenient alternative to regular passwords.

To use One-Time Passwords, they need to be enabled in the configuration:

<Tabs>
 <Tab title="nhost.toml">
 ```toml
 [auth.method.otp.email]
 enabled = true
 ```
 </Tab>
 <Tab title="Dashboard">
 ![sign-in otp](/images/guides/auth/sign-in-otp.png)
 </Tab>
</Tabs>

After the functionality has been enabled the flow is as follows:

1. User requests an OTP:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="javascript">
  ```js
  nhost.auth.signInEmailOTP('user@example.com')
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="react">
  See [react docs](/reference/react/use-sign-in-email-otp) for details
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="vue">
  See [vue docs](/reference/vue/use-sign-in-email-otp) for details
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="dart">
  ```dart
  nhost.auth.signInEmailOTP(email: "user@example.com");
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. User receives an email with the OTP
3. User enters the OTP

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="javascript">
  ```js
  nhost.auth.verifyEmailOTP('user@example.com', '123456')
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="react">
  See [react docs](/reference/react/use-sign-in-email-otp) for details
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="vue">
  See [vue docs](/reference/vue/use-sign-in-email-otp) for details
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="dart">
  ```dart
  nhost.auth.verifyEmailOTP(email: "user@example.com", otp: "123456");
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

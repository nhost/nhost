# Runtimes

The following runtimes are supported:

- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org)
- [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org)
- [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org)

To select your preferred runtime ensure the following configuration is present in your `nhost.toml` file:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js 18">

```toml
[functions.node]
version = 18
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js 20">

```toml
[functions.node]
version = 20
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js 22">

```toml
[functions.node]
version = 22
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Package Managers

For Node.js, the following package managers are supported:

1. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
2. [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
3. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

To use one package manager or another, add the relevant lockfile (either `package-lock.json` for npm, `yarn.lock` for yarn or `pnpm-lock.yaml` for `pnpm`) to the functions folder or a parent folder. If multiple lockfiles are present, preference order is `npm` > `pnpm` > `yarn`.

All you have to do is throw your `.js` and `.ts` files inside of the `./functions` folder of your project and Nhost takes care of deploying your functions as part of a [Deployment](/platform/deployments).

<Info>To deploy Nhost Functions, your project needs to be connected to a GitHub repository.</Info>

## Nhost Functions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">

```js ./functions/hello.js
export default (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TypeScript">

```ts ./functions/hello.ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express'

export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

<Info>
To get the `Request` and `Response` types you have to install the `@types/express` package.

<Tip>Folders and filenames prepended with an underscore are not exposed. This is useful, for example, for utility functions that you want to share across multiple functions.</Tip>

### Endpoints

Functions are exposed through HTTP endpoints generated based on the contents of `./functions`: 

| File                        | HTTP Endpoint                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `functions/index.js`        | `https://[subdomain].functions.[region].nhost.run/v1/`             |
| `functions/users/index.ts`  | `https://[subdomain].functions.[region].nhost.run/v1/users`        |
| `functions/users/active.ts` | `https://[subdomain].functions.[region].nhost.run/v1/users/active` |
| `functions/my-company.js`   | `https://[subdomain].functions.[region].nhost.run/v1/my-company`   |


<Tip>Folders and filenames prepended with an underscore are not exposed. This is useful, for example, for utility functions that you want to share across multiple functions.</Tip>

### Environment Variables

[Environment variables](/platform/environment-variables) are available to your Functions. Both in production and when running Nhost locally using the [Nhost CLI](/development/cli).

The same environment variables that are used to configure event triggers can be used to authenticate functions.

### Billing

Functions are billed per GB-sec or GB-hour. 1 GB-hour is 3600 GB-seconds.

1 GB-sec is 1 Function with 1GB of RAM running for 1 second. If 1 Function with 1GB of RAM runs for 3600 seconds, that's the equivalent of 1 GB-hour.

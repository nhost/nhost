# Upgrade process

<Info>
This document only applies when changing Postgres major version (i.e. from 14 to 15/16 or from 15 to 16). It doesn'e apply when upgrading minor versions (i.e. from 14.5 to 14.11).
</Info>

While new cloud projects ship with Postgres 14 by default, versions 15 and 16 are also supported. To change your major version you can go to Settings -> Database, select the new major version and start the process:

![dashboard settings](/images/guides/database/upgrade_01.png)

<Warning>
Keep in mind that the upgrade process requires downtime. Pay attention to all the information provided to you in the settings page.
</Warning>

After starting the process you can follow it on the same page:

![logs](/images/guides/database/upgrade_02.png)

Finally, you can confirm the upgrade by executing the SQL query `SELECT version();`

![select version()](/images/guides/database/upgrade_03.png)

## Projects with connected repos

This process can only be triggered from the dashboard. If you have a project with a connected repository and want to upgrade postgres to either 15 or 16 you will have to follow the steps below:

1. Upgrade the major version using the dashboard
2. Run `nhost config pull` or edit the `nhost.toml` by hand.
3. Push to git (this step should be a NOOP and can be skipped)

If you attempt to change major versions via a deployment the deployment will fail. This is done on purpose to avoid unintended upgrades which can lead to downtime.

## Introduction

Follow this guide for the necessary configuration steps to use **dnsmasq**, enabling devices on the same network, such as Android emulators or iPhone devices, to connect to your local Nhost project running on your machine.

<Note>
  Make sure to install dnsmasq. The following is how to do it on macOS using hombrew. If you're using another OS please refer to the [dnsmasq website](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html).
  ```shell Terminal
  brew install dnsmasq

    ipconfig getifaddr en0
    ```

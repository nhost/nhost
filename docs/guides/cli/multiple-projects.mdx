By default the name of the project is going to be the folder of the root of your project and it's goint to run on port 443 (https) and 5432 (postgres). If you need to run multiple projects or multiple instances of the same project at the same time you may need to override those. For instance:

```bash
$ nhost up

From now on you can operate on each one of them accordingly by specifying `--project-name`:

```bash
$ nhost --project-name alternativeproject dev logs auth

alternativeproject-auth-1  | > node ./dist/start.js

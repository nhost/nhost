If you want to migrate an existing project you need to:

1. Go into your project's folder:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/existingproject
```

2. Login:

```bash
$ nhost login
- email: david@nhost.io
- password:
Authenticating
Successfully logged in, creating PAT
Successfully created PAT
Storing PAT for future user
```

3. Link your project:

```bash
$ nhost link

   │                      │               │            │              │
 # │ Subdomain            │ Project       │ Workspace  │ Region       │
 1 │ lrkadqfanxgmscttabiv │ demo          │ david-yirq │ eu-central-1 │
   │                      │               │            │              │
- Select # the workspace to link: 1
- Enter project subdomain to confirm: lrkadqfanxgmscttabiv
```

4. Pull the configuration from the cloud:

```bash
$ nhost config pull

- /path/to/existingproject/nhost/nhost.toml already exists. Do you want to overwrite it? [y/N] y
- /path/to/existingproject/.secrets already exists. Do you want to overwrite it? [y/N] y
Pulling config from Nhost...

Adding .secrets to .gitignore...
Success!
- Review `nhost/nhost.toml` and make sure there are no secrets before you commit it to git.
- Review `.secrets` file and set your development secrets
- Review `.secrets` was added to .gitignore
```

5. Follow the instructions on screen to ensure your configuration contains no secrets and you don't commit sensitive information to git.

6. Profit:

```bash
$ nhost up

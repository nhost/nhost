You can enable Graphite, Nhost's AI service, with the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your database version">
    Check your project's settings and make sure the database version is at least `14.6-20231018-1`. If it isn't upgrade your database version (latest available version is recommended).

      <Tab title="Dashboard">
        ![database settings](/images/guides/ai/enabling/database.png)
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="toml">
        ```toml
        [postgres]
        version = '14.6-20231018-1'
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get an OpenAPI key">
    Get an OpenAI API key from their [customer portal](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the service">
    Finally, you can head to your project's settings -> AI section and enable the service or, alternatively, use your TOML configuration file to enable the service:

      </Tab>

      <Tab title="toml">
        ```toml
        [ai]
        # Version of the service to use. Check the settings page for available versions
        version = '0.3.1'

        # Used to validate requests between postgres and the AI service.
        # The AI service will also include the header X-Graphite-Webhook-Secret
        # with this value set when calling external webhooks so the source of
        # the request can be validated.
        webhookSecret = '{{ secrets.GRAPHITE_WEBHOOK_SECRET }}'

        [ai.autoEmbeddings]
        # How often to run the job that keeps embeddings up to date
        synchPeriodMinutes = 5

        [ai.openai]
        # Key to use for authenticating API requests to OpenAI.
        apiKey = '{{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}'
        # OpenAI organization to use.
        organization = 'my-org'

        [ai.resources.compute]
        # Dedicated resources allocated for the service
        cpu = 128
        memory = 256
        ```
      </Tab>

    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Local Development

If you are using the Nhost CLI for development, as of [v0.11.1](https://github.com/nhost/cli/releases/tag/v1.11.1) you can also start Graphite locally. To do so start by adding the AI service to the `nhost.toml` as instructed above (don't forget to add the relevant secrets to your `.secrets` file) and then start nhost:

![nhost up](/images/guides/ai/enabling/nhost_up.png)

After starting the service the first thing you will notice is that there is a new `ai` service running. The second thing you will notice is that this service proposed a few metadata changes:

### Auto-Embeddings

If you add [auto-embeddings](/guides/ai/auto-embeddings) configuration locally and want to synchronize them with the cloud we recommend inserting them using a migration rather than with the auto-embeddings UI:


And then running `nhost up` to download the updated the metadata. Afterwards you should see both database migrations and functions' metadata changes:


Alternatively you can modify your auto-embeddings configuration in all of your environments using the UI.

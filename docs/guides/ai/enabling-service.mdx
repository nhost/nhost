You can enable Graphite, Nhost's AI service, with the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your database version">
    Check your project's settings and make sure the database version is at least `14.6-20231018-1`. If it isn't upgrade your database version (latest available version is recommended).

      </Tab>

      <Tab title="toml">
        ```toml
        [postgres]
        version = '14.6-20231018-1'
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get an OpenAPI key">
    Get an OpenAI API key from their [customer portal](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

        ```toml
        [ai]
        # Version of the service to use. Check the settings page for available versions
        version = '0.3.1'

        # Used to validate requests between postgres and the AI service.
        # The AI service will also include the header X-Graphite-Webhook-Secret
        # with this value set when calling external webhooks so the source of
        # the request can be validated.
        webhookSecret = '{{ secrets.GRAPHITE_WEBHOOK_SECRET }}'

        [ai.autoEmbeddings]
        # How often to run the job that keeps embeddings up to date
        synchPeriodMinutes = 5

        [ai.openai]
        # Key to use for authenticating API requests to OpenAI.
        apiKey = '{{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}'
        # OpenAI organization to use.
        organization = 'my-org'

        [ai.resources.compute]
        # Dedicated resources allocated for the service
        cpu = 128
        memory = 256
        ```
      </Tab>

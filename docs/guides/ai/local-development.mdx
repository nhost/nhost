If you are using the Nhost CLI for local development, as of [v0.12.0](https://github.com/nhost/cli/releases/tag/v1.12.0) you can also start Graphite locally. To do so, follow the next steps:



<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuring the Service">
    Follow the steps highlighed in the [Enabling Service](enabling-service) guide and don't forget to add the relevant secrets to your `.secrets` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start nhost">
    Run `nhost up`:

    ![nhost up](/images/guides/ai/local-development/nhost_up.png)

    After starting the service the first thing you will notice is that there is a new `ai` service running.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit metadata changes">
    As you start the AI service metadata changes may be proposed:

    ![git status](/images/guides/ai/local-development/git_status.png)

    We strongly recommmend you to commit them to your git repository so they can be deployed alongside your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>


### Synhcronizing Auto-Embeddings

If you add [auto-embeddings](/guides/ai/auto-embeddings) configuration locally and want to synchronize them with the cloud we recommend inserting them using a migration rather than with the auto-embeddings UI:

![migration](/images/guides/ai/local-development/migration.png)

And then running `nhost up` to download the updated metadata. Afterwards you should see both database migrations and functions' metadata changes in your local project:

![git status](/images/guides/ai/local-development/git_status_functions.png)

Pushing them to your deployment branch will also deploy them to your cloud project.

### Synhcronizing Assistants

Similar to auto-embeddings, if you want to synchronize [assistants](/guides/ai/assistants) we recommend you to insert them using a migration and then running `nhost up` to update any metadata if necessary. After pushing the proposed changes to the deployment branch all the changes should be deployed to the cloud project.

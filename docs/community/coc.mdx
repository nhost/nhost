As a community-driven company, Nhost is committed to creating an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members, regardless of factors such as age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

However, diverse communities may face challenges, such as potential misunderstandings and miscommunications. To ensure respectful interactions, free from behaviour that may create an unsafe environment, we have established this Code of Conduct.

These guidelines do not cover every possible scenario comprehensively but serve as a guiding light towards courteous interactions among community members, aligning with the overarching principle of avoiding unprofessional behaviour. This Code of Conduct applies to all events and participants, aiming to maintain a welcoming and healthy environment for our community.

Traits of a Nhost community member include:

### Being considerate and using appropriate channels

Contributions of every kind have far-ranging consequences. Just as your work depends on the work of others, decisions you make surrounding your contributions to the Nhost community will affect your fellow community members. Use appropriate channels for what you're about to say and refrain from tagging a role that sends out a lot of pings. You are strongly encouraged to take those consequences into account while making decisions.

### Adhering to these standards

It's crucial to keep in mind that our community members are from all kinds of backgrounds, so the members are expected to:

- Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people
- Be respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Give and accept constructive feedback gracefully
- Accept responsibility and apologise to those affected by mistakes, and learn from such experiences
- Focus on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community!

### Patience

Our community thrives on the generosity of volunteered time. Questions, contributions, and support requests may embark on a time-travelling journey before finding their destination. Repeated "bumps" or persistent "reminders" don't display patience and are looked down upon. Lastly, it is a bad practice to ask general questions to a specific person (in direct messages for example). Try to ask in public as much as you can, and patiently wait for the response

### Inclusivity, kindness and respectfulness

Please be courteous and respectful to fellow members. Avoid offensive comments related to age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

Strictly prohibited are sexualized imagery, violence, intimidation, stalking, disruptions, sharing personal information without explicit permission, unwanted physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Use inclusive language respecting our community's diversity.

Avoid assumptions about others' backgrounds. Maintain a positive and professional demeanour, refraining from threatening or inappropriate behaviour.

**We have zero tolerance for discrimination**. Any form of discrimination, including harassment, will lead to immediate consequences, potentially expulsion.

### Inquisitive

**_The only stupid question is the one that does not get asked_**.

We encourage our users to ask early and ask often. Rather than asking whether you can ask a question (the answer is always yes!), instead, simply ask your question. You are encouraged to provide as many specifics as possible.

Code snippets in the form of images are bad practice. Instead, use text formatted as code (using backticks) on Discord or simply send a gist. Refrain from pasting multiple lines of code directly into the chat channels - instead use [gist.github.com](http://gist.github.com/) or another paste site to provide code snippets.

### Helpful

Nhost welcomes users of all skill levels. We were all beginners once, and a supportive environment is essential for the community to thrive. While it can be repetitive to answer the same questions, members are expected to be courteous and helpful to everyone.

Avoid sarcastic responses and prioritize useful information. Everyone should read the provided documentation. We're here to answer questions, offer guidance, and suggest workflows, but not to do your job for you.

### Anti-harassment policy

Harassment includes (but is not limited to) all of the following behaviors:

- Offensive comments related to gender (including gender expression and identity), age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, and religion.
- Derogatory terminology including words commonly known to be slurs
- Posting sexualized images or imagery in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation
- Stalking
- Posting others' personal information without explicit permission
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention

Immediate compliance is expected from participants asked to cease harassing behaviour. Sponsors must adhere to the anti-harassment policy, refraining from using sexualized images or creating a sexualized environment at events. Volunteer organizers, including meetup staff, should also avoid sexualized attire.

Continuing inappropriate behaviour after being asked to stop constitutes harassment, even if not explicitly mentioned in this policy. It is respectful to stop doing something when asked to do so, and all community members are expected to promptly comply with such requests.

### Reporting policy violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to anyone with administrative power in the community (Admins or Moderators on Discord, members of the 'DevRel' role), or to the local organizers of an event or to [our support team](https://app.nhost.io/support). Meetup organizers are encouraged to prominently display points of contact for reporting unacceptable behaviour at local events.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate. These actions may include but are not limited to warning the offender, expelling the offender from the event, and barring the offender from future community events.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts to an alternate location, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe during the meetup. We value the safety and well-being of our community members and want everyone to feel welcome at our events, both online and offline.

We expect all participants, organizers, speakers, and attendees to follow these policies at all of our event venues and event-related social events.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**

- `Community Impact`: Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
- `Consequence`: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**

- `Community Impact`: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
- `Consequence`: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**

- `Community Impact`: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour.
- `Consequence`: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban**

- `Community Impact`: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

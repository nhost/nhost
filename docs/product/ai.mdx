Graphite, Nhost's AI service, extends the [Nhost stack](https://nhost.io) providing AI super-powers to your application.

## Features

* Auto-Embeddings
  * Generate embeddings for your data automatically as it is inserted or modified
  * Provide a GraphQL query for similarity searches to compare objects in your database
  * Provide a GraphQL query to search objects using natural language
  * Embeddings sources supported:
    * [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)
    * More to come (if you are interested in seeing support for any model/platform don't hesitate to let us know)
* AI Assistants
  * Create AI assistants so your users can interact with your data using AI.
  * Different AI assistants can have different views of your data
  * Extend with custom data via webhooks
  * Automate workflows by exposing GraphQL queries or mutations or custom webhooks to the AI assistant
  * GraphQL API to interact with the assistants.
  * Permissions fully integrated with hasura and hasura-auth; control who and who can not use which assistant via permissions.
  * Access to the underlying data for the assistant is limited to what the user can see.
* Developer Assistant
  * Custom AI assistant with access to your project's information (i.e. database/graphql schema)
  * Allow the developers in your team to leverage AI to develop faster and better

### Auto-Embeddings

Embeddings are automatically generated based on defined rules and a new GraphQL query to search objects using natural language is automatically added to the schema:

Similarly, a GraphQL schema to search for similar objects is also provided:

![auto-embeddings-similar](/images/product/ai/auto-embeddings-similar.png)

Both queries respect the user session and permissions so only results the user is allowed to see are returned.

In addition, thanks to [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) you can easily perform any operations on the generated embeddings directly from your application.

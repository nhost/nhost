Hasura is a powerful GraphQL engine that generates **realtime GraphQL APIs** from your Postgres database. 

## Instant APIs

Instant APIs on all your data. 

```graphql
query GetTodos {
  todos {
    title
    completed
  }
}
```

### Permissions

Define granular, role-based permissions at the level of rows and columns.

- Apollo Client
- URQL
- React Query
- SWR
- etc

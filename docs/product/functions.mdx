Nhost Functions are server-side JavaScript or TypeScript functions that are a great option for handling things like Event Triggers for async workflows, as well as to integrate with external service providers like Stripe or Slack.

<Tip>
  For more sophisticated use-cases and control over the runtime, use [Nhost Run](/product/run).
</Tip>

## Hello World

```js ./functions/hello-world.js
export default (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello World!`)
}
```

Deploying functions is as easy as pushing your code!

Nhost CLI, or `nhost`, is a command-line interface that lets you run and manage Nhost projects locally on Mac, Linux, and Windows (WSL2).

This means you get a full-featured Nhost project running locally on your machine:

- Postgres Database
- Hasura GraphQL API
- Hasura Console
- Authentication
- Storage
- Serverless Functions

This way, you can develop and test local changes before you deploy them. The CLI automatically tracks:

- Postgres Database Migrations
- Hasura Metadata
- [Serverless Functions](/serverless-functions)
- [Email Templates](/authentication/email-templates)

It's recommended to use [Git](/platform/git) for Nhost to automatically deploy changes to your Nhost project on `git push`.

## Installation

To download and install Nhost CLI, run the following command:

```bash
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhost/cli/main/get.sh | bash
```

### Dependencies

The following dependencies are required:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (must be running while using the CLI)

:::info

Make sure you have the correct permissions for Docker so you don't have to run Docker with `sudo`. See ["Post-installation steps for Linux"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) from Docker's documentation.

## Get started

Start by authenticating yourself to Nhost Cloud:

```
nhost login
```

Once signed in, you can list all your Nhost projects using:

```
nhost list
```

Let's start by initializing a remote Nhost project locally with the following command:

```
nhost init --remote
```

Pick a Nhost project to use then change the directory once the project initialization is completed:

```
cd my_test_app
```

Then start the Nhost project locally:

```
nhost up
```

Hasura Console starts automatically and your Nhost project is running locally.

## Subdomain and Region

Use `local` as the `subdomain`, and skip `region` when using the CLI and the [JavaScript SDK](/reference/javascript):

```js
import { NhostClient } from '@nhost/nhost-js'

const nhost = new NhostClient({
  subdomain: 'local'
})
```

## Emails

During local development with the CLI, all transactional emails from Nhost Authentication are sent to a local Mailhog services, instead of to the recipient's email address.

The Mailhog address is listed after starting [`nhost up`](/reference/cli/up):

```
$ nhost up
URLs:
- Postgres:         postgres://postgres:postgres@local.db.nhost.run:5432/postgres
- Hasura:           https://local.hasura.nhost.run
- GraphQL:          https://local.graphql.nhost.run/v1
- Auth:             https://local.auth.nhost.run/v1
- Storage:          https://local.storage.nhost.run/v1
- Functions:        https://local.functions.nhost.run/v1

- Dashboard:        http://localhost:3030
// highlight-start
- Mailhog:          http://localhost:8025
// highlight-end

- subdomain:       local
- region:          (empty)
```

Let's say you want to build a CRM system and you want to store files for customers. This is one way how you could do that.

Start with, you would have two tables:

1. `customers` - Customer data.
2. `customer_files` - What file belongs to what customer

```text
- customers
  - id
  - name
  - address

customer_files
  - id
  - customer_id (Foreign Key to `customers.id`)
  - file_id (Foreign Key to `storage.files.id`)
```

You would also create a [Hasura Relationship](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/table-relationships/index/) (GraphQL relationship) between between `customers` and `customer_files` and between `customer_files` and `storage.files`.

With the two tables and GraphQL relationships in place, you can query customers and the customer's files like this:

```graphql
query {
  customers {
    # customers table
    id
    name
    customer_files {
      # customer_files table
      id
      file {
        # storage.files table
        id
        name
        size
        mimeType
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The file upload process would be as follows:

1. Upload a file.
2. Get the returned file id.
3. Insert (GraphQL Mutation) the file `id` and the customer's `id` into the `customer_files` table.

This would allow you to upload and download files belonging to specific customers in your CRM system.

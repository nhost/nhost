Let's create a simple todo-app using Nhost. In a todo-app, a user should be able to create list items for their account (CRUD) and not have anyone else see them (permissions).

To implement this todo-app with Nhost, we'll briefly cover these topics:

- Creating a new app on Nhost
- Defining a database schema
- Inserting data
- Setting permissions
- Querying data via the GraphQL API

By the end of this quick-start, you will better understand what Nhost is and what it does for you.

## Log in to Nhost

Go to [app.nhost.io](https://app.nhost.io) and sign up for a new account if you don't have one already.

---

## Create app

Press the **"New App"** button on the console's home page. Choose a name and pick the region closest to your users.

You'll be all set with the Default Workspace and the Free plan for now.

Creating a new app takes around 20 seconds or so. During this time, Nhost sets up your app's entire backend and infrastructure.

Once the setup completes, you'll automatically see the app dashboard, and you're ready to define your app's database schema.

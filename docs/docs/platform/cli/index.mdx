Nhost CLI, or `nhost`, is a command-line interface that lets you run and manage Nhost projects locally on Mac, Linux, and Windows (WSL2).

This means you get a full-featured Nhost project running locally on your machine:

- Postgres Database
- Hasura GraphQL API
- Hasura Console
- Authentication
- Storage
- Serverless Functions

This way, you can develop and test local changes before you deploy them live. The CLI automatically tracks:

- Postgres database migrations
- Hasura metadata
- Serverless Functions

It's recommended to commit and push changes to GitHub and use the [GitHub integration](/platform/github-integration) for Nhost to automatically deploy those changes live.

## Installation

To download and install Nhost CLI, run the following command:

```bash
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhost/cli/main/get.sh | bash
```

### Dependencies

The following dependencies are required:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (must be running while using the CLI)

:::info

Make sure you have the correct permissions for Docker so you don't have to run Docker with `sudo`. See ["Post-installation steps for Linux"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) from Docker's documentation.

## Get started

Start by authenticating yourself to Nhost Cloud:

```
nhost login
```

Once signed in, you can list all your Nhost projects using:

```
nhost list
```

Let's start by initializing a remote Nhost project locally with the following command:

```
nhost init --remote
```

Pick a Nhost project to use then change the directory once the project initialization is completed:

```
cd my_test_app
```

Then start the Nhost project locally:

```
nhost up
```

Hasura Console starts automatically and your Nhost project is running locally.

## Subdomain and Region

Use `localhost` as the `subdomain`, and skip `region` when using the CLI and the [JavaScript SDK](/reference/javascript):

```js
import { NhostClient } from '@nhost/nhost-js'

const nhost = new NhostClient({
  subdomain: 'localhost'
})
```

## Emails

During local development with the CLI, all transactional emails from Nhost Authentication are sent to a local Mailhog services, instead of to the recipient's email address.

The Mailhog address is listed after starting [`nhost up`](/reference/cli/up):

```
$ nhost up
URLs:
- Postgres:         postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
- GraphQL:          http://localhost:1337/v1/graphql
- Auth:             http://localhost:1337/v1/auth
- Storage:          http://localhost:1337/v1/storage
- Functions:        http://localhost:1337/v1/functions

- Hasura console:  http://localhost:9695
// highlight-start
- Mailhog:         http://localhost:8025
// highlight-end

- subdomain:       localhost
- region:          (empty)
```

Follow this guide to sign in users with email and password.

The email and password sign-in method is enabled by default for all Nhost apps.

## Sign Up

Users must first sign up to be able to sign in with Email and Password.

**Example:** Sign up users using the [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript).

```js
await nhost.auth.signUp({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
})
```

If you've turned on email verification in your app's **login settings**, a user will be sent a verification email upon signup. The user must click the verification link in the email before they can sign in.

## Sign In

Once a user has been signed up (and optionally verified), you can sign them in.

**Example:** Sign in users using the [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript).

```js
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
})
```

## Verified Emails

You can decide if only verified emails should be able to sign in or not. Modify the **Only allow login for verified emails.** setting in the **Login Settings** section under **Users** in your Nhost app.

An email-verification email is automatically sent to the user during sign-up if your app only allows to sign in users with verified emails. You can also manually send the verification email to the user using [`nhost.auth.sendVerificationEmail()`](/reference/javascript/auth/send-verification-email).

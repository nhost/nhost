Follow this guide to sign in users with Magic Link, also called passwordless email.

The Magic Link sign-in method enables you to sign in users using an email address, without requiring a password.

## Sign In

To sign in users with Magic Link is a two-step process:

1. Send a Magic Link to the user's email address.
2. The user clicks the Magic Link in their email to sign in.

Use the [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript) to sign up users with Magic Link:

```js
nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'joe@example.com'
})
```

If you want to change the email for your magic link emails, you can do so by changing the [email templates](/platform/authentication/email-templates).

Here's a guide on how to use Nhost with multiple environments and how to set up a workflow around them.

For this example, we'll set up one **production environment** and one **staging environment**.

## Git

Create a new Git repo and use the [CLI](/cli) and the `nhost init` command to initialize a new project.

Also, create a new branch called `staging`.

You should now have a Git repo with a `main` branch and a `staging` branch.

## Nhost Cloud

To have two environments, we need to create two projects on Nhost Cloud.

Both projects must be connected to the **same** [Git](/platform/git) repo, but using **different** [deployment branches](/platform/git#deployment-branch).

Set your production project to use the `main` branch as the Deployment Branch and your staging project to use the `staging` branch as the Deployment Branch. This way, the production project will only deploy new changes to the `main` branch and the staging project will only deploy new changes to the `staging` branch.

## Development

### Local

Now, use the CLI to do [local development](/cli/local-development). And use a specific feature branch while doing development.

### Staging

Once you're ready to test your changes to staging, create a pull request from your feature branch to the `staging` branch. Then, merge the pull request to `staging`.

This will automatically trigger a new deployment to the staging project on the Nhost platform.

### Production

Once you've tested your changes in the staging environment, you can create a new pull request from the `staging` branch to the `main` branch. Then, merge the pull request to `main`.

This will automatically trigger a new deployment to the production project on the Nhost platform.

## Summary

Now you have two environments, one for staging and one for production. You can use this workflow to do local development, and test your changes in a staging environment before deploying them to production.

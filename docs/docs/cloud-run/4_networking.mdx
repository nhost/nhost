Nhost Cloud Run services and the main Nhost stack share the same network, facilitating direct and efficient communication. This network connectivity offers low latency, high throughput, and eliminates egress costs.
## Connecting to the Nhost stack

To connect your service to the Nhost stack, use the following information:

- postgres: `postgres://postgres:<password>@postgres-service:5432/<subdomain>?sslmode=disable`
- hasura: base URL is `http://hasura-service:8080`
- hasura-auth: base URL is `http://hasura-auth-service:4000`
- hasura-storage: base URL is `http://hasura-storage-service:5000`

## Connecting to your service internally

To connect to your own service internally from another service, follow these steps:

1. Expose the desired port(s).

Example for MySQL service:

```
name = "mysql"

...

[[ports]]
type = "tcp"
port = 3306
publish = false
...
```

2. Once the port is exposed, you can connect to the service using its name and the corresponding port.

Example: `mysql://user@mysql:3306`

If needed, you can open internally more than one port by repeating the block for each one of them:

Example for a service exposing the ports tcp/3000 and udp/4000:


```
name = "mysvc"

...
[[ports]]
type = "tcp"
port = 3000
publish = false

[[ports]]
type = "udp"
port = 4000
publish = false
...
````

## Exposing Your Service to the Internet

To expose your service to the internet, follow these steps:

1. Update your configuration with the relevant port information:

Example for a nodejs service exposing an API on port 3000:

```
name = "mysvc"

...

[[ports]]
type = "http"
port = 3000
publish = true

```

:::info
Currently, only services of type `http` can be exposed to the internet.

	2.	Once the service of type `http` is published, you can connect to it using a URL with the following format:
* `https://<subdomain>-<svc_name>-<port>.svc.<region>.nhost.run`

For example:

* `https://zlbmqjfczuwqvsquujno-mysvc-3000.svc.eu-central-1.nhost.run`

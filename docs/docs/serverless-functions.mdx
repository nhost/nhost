With Nhost, you can deploy Serverless Functions to execute custom code. Each Serverless Function is its HTTP endpoint.

Serverless functions can be used to handle [event triggers](/database/event-triggers), form submissions, integrations (e.g. Stripe, Slack, etc), and more.

## Create a Serverless Function

Every `.ts` (TypeScript) and `.js` (JavaScript) file in the `functions/` folder of your Nhost project is its own Serverless Function.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

```ts title=functions/test.ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express'

export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

:::info

To get the `Request`, and `Response` types you can install the `@types/express` package.

```bash
npm install -d @types/express
# or yarn
yarn add -d @types/express
# or pnpm
pnpm add -d @types/express
```

:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js title=functions/test.js
export default (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Deploying Serverless Functions

Serverless Functions are automatically deployed using Nhost's [Git integration](/platform/git).

All Serverless Functions are deployed with the following options:

- Node v16
- 1024 MB memory (can be upgraded)
- 10 seconds timeout (can be upgraded)
- 6 MB request and response payload size limit

## Routing

HTTP endpoints are automatically generated based on the file structure inside `functions/`.

Here's an example of four Serverless Functions with their files and their HTTP endpoints:

| File                        | HTTP Endpoint                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `functions/index.js`        | `https://[project-subdomain].nhost.run/v1/functions/`             |
| `functions/users/index.ts`  | `https://[project-subdomain].nhost.run/v1/functions/users`        |
| `functions/users/active.ts` | `https://[project-subdomain].nhost.run/v1/functions/users/active` |
| `functions/my-company.js`   | `https://[project-subdomain].nhost.run/v1/functions/my-company`   |

You can prepend files and folders with an underscore (`_`) to prevent them from being treated as Serverless Functions and
be turned into HTTP endpoints. This is useful if you have, for example, a utils file (`functions/_utils.js`) or a utils-f
older (`functions/_utils/<utils-files>.js`).

## Environment Variables

[Environment variables](/platform/environment-variables) are available inside your Serverless Functions. Both in production and when running Nhost locally using the [Nhost CLI](/cli).

## Examples

We have multiple examples of Serverless Functions in our [Nhost repository](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/tree/main/examples/serverless-functions/functions).

## Billing

Serverless Functions are billed per GB-sec or GB-hour. 1 GB-hour is 3600 GB-seconds.

1 GB-sec is 1 Serverless Function with 1 GB of RAM running for 1 second. If 1 Serverless Function with 1 GB of RAM runs for 3600 seconds, that's the equivalent of 1 GB-hour.

## Regions

Serverless Functions are always deployed to the same region as your project.

## Local Debugging

Use `nhost logs functions -f` to see the logs of your Serverless Functions when develop locally with the [Nhost CLI](/cli).

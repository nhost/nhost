Initialize a local Nhost project.

```
nhost init
```

If you already have a Nhost project in Nhost Cloud you can use that project as a starting point by appending `--remote` to the command.

```
nhost init --remote
```

This will reset and pull the database migrations and Hasura metadata from the Nhost Cloud project locally for you to use as a starting point. While doing `nhost init --remote` it's also recommended to setup [Git](/platform/git) to activate automated deplouments on `git push` for your Nhost project.

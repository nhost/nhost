Intialize a local Nhost project in the current working directory.

```
nhost init
```

If you already have a Nhost project in Nhost Cloud you can use that project as a starting point by appending `--remote` to the command.

This will pull the database migrations and Hasura metadata from the Nhost Cloud project locally for you to use as a starting point.

```
nhost init --remote
```

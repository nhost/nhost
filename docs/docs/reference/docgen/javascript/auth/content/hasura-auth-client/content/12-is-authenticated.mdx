# `isAuthenticated()`

Use `nhost.auth.isAuthenticated` to check if the user is authenticated or not.

Note: `nhost.auth.isAuthenticated()` can return `false` for two reasons:

1. The user is not authenticated
2. The user is not authenticated but _might_ be authenticated soon (loading) because there is a network request in transit.

Use `nhost.auth.getAuthenticationStatus` to get both authentication and loading status.

```ts
const isAuthenticated = nhost.auth.isAuthenticated()

if (isAuthenticated) {
  console.log('User is authenticated')
}
```

Nhost Run enables you to seamlessly incorporate your custom software within your project environment. With this feature, you can run various applications, including homegrown backend services, agents, extensions for your GraphQL API through remote schemas or actions, data-processing workloads, etc., all in close proximity to your database for low latency, speed, and efficiency.

:::info
Currently Nhost Run is in public beta. If you find any bugs or if you have any feedback and suggestions, please reach out to us via [email](mailto:support@nhost.io), [GitHub](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/issues), or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9V7Qb2U)

## Use Cases

Nhost Run allows you to expand and truly customize your backend in multiple ways:

1.	Homegrown Backend Services: Deploy and execute your custom backend services within your project environment.
2.	GraphQL API Extensions: Extend your GraphQL API functionalities by incorporating remote schemas or actions.
3.	Data-Processing Workloads: Execute data-processing tasks in close proximity to your database for enhanced efficiency.
4. OSS and third-party software: Redis, memcache, datadog agents, mysql, mongodb... anything your application needs.

## Advantages

Nhost Run offers several key advantages for running workloads alongside your project:

1. **Minimal Latency**: By running workloads alongside your project environment, Nhost Run reduces latency between services. This means that the communication and data exchange between different components of your project can occur quickly and efficiently.
2. **Improved Reliability**: Nhost Run eliminates the dependency on external internet connectivity. This increased reliability ensures that your workloads continue to function even in scenarios where internet access may be limited or disrupted.
3. **No Egress Costs**: With Nhost Run, you won't incur additional egress costs for transferring data between your project and the cloud infrastructure. This cost-saving benefit allows you to manage your expenses more effectively.
4. **Integrated operations**: Develop, build, manage and scale your own workloads the same way you can manage your Nhost Project.

By leveraging Nhost Run, you can optimize the performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency of your project by running workloads alongside it.

## Requirements

Nhost Run works with container images built for the **arm architecture**. Images can be pulled from the [Nhost's private registry](/run/registry) or from any other publicly available registry.

## Roadmap

Some missing functionality we are currently working on and should be added soon:

1. Run services with the CLI alongside your project
2. Ability to connect services to repositories for automated building and deployment (currently this needs to be done via a third party CI, see [Deployment via CI](/run/ci) for more details).
3. Expose TCP/UDP ports

Introducing `useSendVerificationEmail`

While `useSignInEmailPassword` automatically sends a verification email (when the backend is configured to do so), an user may sometime want to request for an verification email to be sent again. See the [documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react/hooks#send-email-verification) for further information about how to use this hook.

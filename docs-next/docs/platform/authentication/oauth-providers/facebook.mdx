## Activate Facebook permissions and features

To make sure we can fetch all user data (email, profile picture and name). For that we need to enable **email** and **public_profile** permissions.

- Click the checkbox “**I have pasted the redirect URI into Facebook”**.
- Click **Confirm settings**.

## Sign In users in your app

  provider: 'facebook',
});
```

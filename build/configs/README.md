# Configuration Files

This directory contains standardized configurations for various tools and frameworks used across the repository.

## Available Configurations

- [**TypeScript (`/tsconfig`)**](./tsconfig/README.md): Centralized TypeScript configurations for different project types

  - Standard base configuration with strict type checking
  - Specialized configurations for libraries, frontend apps, and Node.js
  - Documented usage patterns and extension points

## Using the Configurations

Each configuration directory contains a README with specific instructions on how to use the configurations in your projects.

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: All projects follow the same standards and best practices
- **Maintainability**: Configuration changes can be made in one place and propagated to all projects
- **Onboarding**: New projects can quickly adopt the standard configurations

## Adding New Configurations

When adding new centralized configurations:

1. Create a new subdirectory with an appropriate name
2. Include a README.md explaining the configurations
3. Document both the usage and the reasoning behind configuration choices

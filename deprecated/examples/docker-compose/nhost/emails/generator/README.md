# How to generate emails for a new locale

The emails are made using (`react.email`)[https://react.email/] and they can be edited and previewd running the
following command at the root of the repo:

```sh
pnpm dev:email
```

To generate email templates for a new locale, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm generate:emails <locale>
```

Once the script finishes, a new folder will be created under the email-templates directory, named according
to the new locale. You can then edit the email text to match the specific localeâ€™s language.

For example to generate emails for the German locale (de) you run:

```sh
pnpm generate:emails de
```
